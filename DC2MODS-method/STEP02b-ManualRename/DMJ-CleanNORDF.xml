SHORT STORY BY DORIS MCCARTHY
The well was dug by hand, three feet in diameter and
lined with brick.  In spite of a dowser's locating the right
spot, the men had to go down fifty-two feet before they found
water.  Fifty-two feet is a long way, too far for a pump to pull.
They had to build a platform down in the depths for the pump to
sit where it could push the water up.  There was a cover over the
well where I could stand to work a handle up and down to activate
the pump far below.
I used the boulders that they dug out with the sand and
clay to make a rock garden around the the top of the well and
painted the pump handle blue to match the forget-me -nots.
Happiness was being able to fill a pail with water from my own
well instead of carrying it out from the city.
But not for long.  It turned out that the water was
coming through a layer of such fine sand that the sand came with
the water and finally choked the pump.  I consulted the well-
digger, a stocky little Glaswegian whose accent had to be heard
to be believed.  He advised that the only remedy would be a
concrete collar inside the bricks through which the water could
seep but not the sand.  But his mate had gone off to do war work
and it was a two man job.  Tough but no go. Sorry.
With great difficulty I persuaded him to let me act as

his assistant.  This turned out to mean being lowered on a foot
sling down to the platform below to receive the buckets of
concrete and shovelling the mucky stuff into the form which Bill
had built and fixed in place.  Bill stayed on top because mixing
the cement and sand and winching the buckets down to me was the
trickier job. I wore a saucepan on my head, handle turned to the
back as a hard hat in case of spills.  And down there, lit by the
sky above the shaft, I worked.  From time to time Bill's voice
would echo down to me.  "Doris , do you want to come up for a
cigarette?".and I would step into the sling and be winched up to
the surface where I became instantly "Miss McCarthy".
Once as I sat smoking with Bill, complete with hard hat
and all the splatters, a car came creeping over the bumps in the
dirt road and out stepped my mother's cousin from
Rosedale with my Westmount aunt from Montreal.  It was not as
they had envisaged a call on their neice to see her new home.
There was no way I could offer tea and they did not linger.  But
the memory of that comic moment has stayed with me for sixty
years.

      <dc:subject>McCarthy, Doris, 1910-2010 - Short Stories</dc:subject>
      <dc:description>A short story written for a woman's magazine describing the daily routine of an atypical housewife. No date available.
SPONTANEOUS LIYINB - OR HOW NEVER TO BE TIRED
I've been reading your magazine for years. My living room is piled with back
numbers and I think they're wonderful. But in all those years I've looked in vain
for an article written by someone like me. I see a heading "I'm nit a Slave to
my House" and I think "Here it is, at last." But when I read it I discover that
the author is just like all the other housekeepers who write for magazines. She
keeps an eight room house clean, does all her own canning, super-trains two children,
makes their clothes, runs the local garden club and paints Swedish designs on old
furniture in her spar© time.
Now I'm not a bit like that. Even thinking about being like that exhausts mo
so much that I go and lie down for a while and smoke a cigarette or have a little
sleep. But I think its time somebody put down in print how the other half lives.
I suppose, on analysis, my day has a routine. I've never felt that the routine
was at all rigid. But the alarm clock goes off at 7.00 A.M. sharp. Jimmie is a
very sound sleeper and so am I, so we wind it full to the limit every night and
hang it from the top of the bed between our heads. It goes off less than a foot
from my ear but I don't hear it. In all the three years I've been married I never
have heard it. Neither has Jimmie. Nobody can understand why we still wind it
up and set it. But I think that to stop trying shows a defeatist attitude to life.
At 7.50 one of our friends telephones and somehow this does wake us up. Mother
says its my social instinct operating even when I'm unconscious. We've tried
different people for this telephone duty. Mother did it for a while after we were
married. The girl who does it now is a school teacher and dependable but she has
long holidays and sometimes she forgets to get up on Saturday morning. Neither
Jimmie nor I feel that she is the perfect solution. But we've used her for the
last two years because besides being quite reliable she is psychic almost. Sometimes if she feels that Jimmie has had a particularly hollow jauntiness in his
"good morning" she telephones again half an hour later. The chances are that he
did go back to bed and to sleep that morning.

SPONTANEOUS LIVING    cont'd
Most of this is hearsay to me. of course. I make Jimmy's breakfast and sometimes
eat with him but I never really know how it all happens. I'm always surprised when
Jimmie telephones about noon to tell me that he loves me and is sorry about the
quarrel we had before he left. He's wonderful. I didn't even know we had quarrelled.
I suppose I go back to sleep after breakfast. Yes of course I do. I can
remember the feeling that comes over me when I start to make the bed. I always
intend to make it and tidy up, but it hypnotizes me. I feel as if the pillows came
up slowly and wrapped themselves around my neck. One friend of mine who is a psychologist and awfully clever, says that instead of the pillows coming up what really
happens is that I go down to them.
Sometimes the kitten wakes me. She's apt to practice diving from the foot
board of the bed on to my chest. But often the first thing I hear is the telephone
again. It's Ruth to ask me over for lunch. I'm shocked to hear that its lunch time.
We discuss cur respective refrigerators and whichever one seemB to be best stocked
wins. It its' Ruth's, I fly around in a hurry, make the bed, tidy the bedroom, do
last nights* and this morning's dishes, empty yesterdays ash trays, pick up yesterday's
magazines, rush around with a carpet sweeper, mop and duster, feed the kitten, put
the washing to soak, dress and rush over to Ruth's with a dessert from last night in
one hand, and two cold sausages wrapped in wax paper in the other. Ruth is a deliberate
and thorough sort of person. By this time she has set the table and the kettle is
boiling.
We share a tremendous enthusiasm for food. Of course I don't think I could ever
be fast friends with an indifferent eater. We agree that even cold sausages must
be served graciously. We have flowers on the table, Susie Cooper China, gay place
mats, and an exquisite sense of leisure. Luncheon gees on and on. We drift from
the table to the chesterfield. That's one of the great advantages of a living
room - dining room. We haven't half finished our review of current reading and the
by paths of philosophy, manners and morals down which it leads us before the telephone
interrupts. Someone wants us to go over for tea.

Ruth stacks the dishes while I sit down again for a while and make a list. I
find making lists systematically of all the things I should do takes less time than
doing them and I can smoke while I work. I put this list into my purse with all the
other lists I have made, and set out for tea with an easier mind.
It is late when I get home, I don't know why, but the really interesting things
get said at the end of the afternoon. So I do the shopping in haste and dash into
the apartment.
Probably Jean, my human alarm clock, is already there. I usually find her
stretched out on the chesterfield beside the remains of a sandwich' and a glass of
milk, with my old magazines open on her chest and strewn about the floor beside her.
She. i* clrt\tvtnc) kome.   j&gt;i«v*\$» S^s    t$ alw&amp;^jS d i"t\u)%i\a   Wou%e    pl&lt;xr\"5.
She 1b- alwavs drawing house plana-. I curl up beside her with a cigarette and inspect the latest version. We argue about kitchens. Finally she jumps up to go,
assuring me that she can't possibly stay for dinner. She has work to do and she
had a snack so she isn't hungry. Neither of us take this seriously. I coax her
and she finally stays and gets dinner for me. I help and if we don't talk we're
fine. Our usual team time for a good hot dinner is twenty-five minutes, but if
Jimmie is late and we start discussing Life, things burn. I don't know why oysters
stimulate discussion but I've given up buying them. The last two lots were charred
beyond recognition.
Dinner is a delightful hour isn't it? It means flowers, candles, good food,
gaiety, being with the people you love best in the world. It's almost my favourite
time. Jean and Jimmie argue and I change plates and ply them both with food. Dinner
slides into after dinner without any break. Jean may carry her coffee to the
chesterfield while Jimmie pushes his chair back and starts to play with the kitten.
Soon he is on the floor with her, and then in his easy chair in the corner. It
happens without anyone noticing. It is only when I hear his mournful little flute
playing off key with the radio that I realize that evening has come.
Jean looks up from her newest house plan and says it is time she went home. She

has work to do. She removes the dishes on her way out. I have work to do too.
Once in a while I do it, but it seems a shame to spoil a beautiful evening with
work. I can lie on my back and watch Jimmie spreading tools all over the living
room floor and enjoy his preoccupation with frame making while the kitten chases
the shavings.  I can read and think up new and devastating points with which to confront Ruth if she comes over for lunch tomorrow. I can dream about the dear little
babies God seems so slow in sending me.  I can waste my time in all sorts of delightful ways. Someone will probably drop in for a hot drink about eleven o'clock.
Someone always does. It seems to be a comfortable place to come to, worth the effort
of clearing bits of lumber off a chair if Jimmie is feeling creative.
My list reminds me that the floors need polishing, that there are socks to darn,
that I haven't seen the bottom of my clothes basket for six months, but the flowers
cast a lovely shadow on the wall and the kitten has curled up again in my arms. I'm
too comfortable to move. I will remember on our way to bed that I still have to iron
a shirt for Jimmy to wear tomorrow but I'm used to that and it will be dry by morning.
I go to bed content.
Let the other housekeepers cherish their schedules. Let them wash every Monday
and iron on Tuesdays. Let hundreds of worthy women rise at seven o'clock to finish
their housework by noon or know the reason why. I like the way I live.
Once upon a time when the shades of such good housekeepers gathered round to
reproach me I asked Jimmie humbly why he loved me, and now I know.
"Because", he said "YOu're so dopey".

Daisy
"The little elves are awfully mean
They're the Haughtiest sprites that I've ever seen
One stole from me a cup of butter
Before a protest I could utter."
"Well, well, that was a naughty elf
He aught to be ashamed of himself
I hope the evils of his ways he'll learn,
low Daisy dear, it is your turn."
Oh, Queen, my tale is short but sad
It is about those those elfins bad.

Queen -
"Herald, I have ©ailed thee here
To tell my soldiers not to fear
But to go at once to the elfin king
And him to me right quickly bring".
Exit Herald.
"For the present that is off our mind.
I sincerely hope that they can find
Him asleep in his castle cold and bare
Sleeping in state on his golden chair
For if they find him there just so
They can catch him easily you know.
By the power that was given to me
By the Queen of Majic and my  godmother's three
I can conquer the king in his castle grim
If he's sound asleep when we go to sieze him.
But now let us back to our duties get
With a long interruption we have met.
Forget-me-not, with your eyes of blue,
Come now, what shall we hear from you?
You should have no tale of woe,
You are too young to have a foe".

Bluebell -
Queen
"Dear Queen, I have one like the rest,
The Elfins must have thought it best
To harm all the flowers sparing none
For that is exactly what they have done."
- "This settling with the Elfin King will be no joke,
But now let us hear the rest of you folk.
All right, come on little Bluebell,
What have your subjects sent you here to tell"?
"The Elfins tease them till they cry,
And then they wilt and then they die".
"My dear we all can sympathize with you,
The elves have harmed all but a few".
"I hope they will soon reform their ways,
For in the long run it always pays".

"Dear Queen, tliis time you need not worry,
°h I never saw elves in such a hurry
As they were when I chased them away
With my sneezing seeds the
You should have been there
It reallv:jwaa the greatest fun
To see them sneeze and get so red
And try to stand upon their head^
And roll and tumble among the reeds
All on account of ay sneezing seeds."
"I hope you have not been too hard,
For their evil ways they may discard".
"I for one, hope that they do
I can't help liking some can you?"
(Sound of drums horns and cheering)
"Hark! Just hear our sn&amp;diers cheer,
Bid them come in sweet Rosamere,
If we may go by their laughter and shouts
I am quite sure there is no doubt,
That my  orders have been earried out."
Enter Boldhart, herald, king and Rosamere
''Ah, here oomes our Boldhart the brave
Bringing with him the kingly knave"
- "Your Majesty, here is the elf,
A goodly fello?;, I pledge myself
I know you laugh when you see his size,
But if you were to fight him you'd get a surprise,
He's full of jigour and pep and vim,
Though you'd never know it to look at him.
(Flowers laugh)
Well, well, you may laugh, you fairy folk,
But to bring him here it was no $oke".
"Queen Titania, that is right,
We were there and saw the fight."
"Yes, Herald, I believe that is quite true
(Turns to Boldhart)
And we know we owe mo3t of it to you,
So I take the time to thank you here
Come flowers, all give him a cheer
(Fl&amp;wers cheer)
How you may go and rest yourself
While my fairies and I attend to this elf.
Exit Boldhart.
Base King, Are you not ashamed of your past?
Your conduct has been too bad to last,
Read these complaints that my fairies gave me
(hands manuscript to him)
These outrages can no longer be."
"Dear Queen, you fill me with remorse
But let me begin at the troubles' source
It wasn't all my fault dear queen
Though I will admit we were all pretty mean.
Yon know ray elves are a mischievous crowd
But sometimes of them I am justly proud.
Well, times in my kingdom were becoming slow

At last they became so discontented
I listened to their pleas and then consented.
low what they really wanted to do
Was to explore your kingdom through and through
In hope of something new to find
I agreed, I was quite blind
lever thinking it would lead to wrong,
But I saw my mystake before very long
For when they'd explored your realm so vast,
They brought to please me a flower who hast

I should and would have sent her right back to you
But if my elves were insulted, what could I do?
So injuries followed one by one"
King - " And what you have here is what they have done
For the injured little Violet and Bluebell,
Then Buttercup and Daisy into their clutches fell,
But, Goldenrod, ah, she made them scamper!
lever more with her will they tamper.
That day, my elves were in a sorry plight
They sneezed all day and far into the night.
Then wicked deeds followed by the score
But it will not happen any more.
For we are really ashamed of ourselves,
And henceforth, I vouch we'll act more like good elves."
Queen - "Elfin king that's nobly said,
Somehow or other we've been led
To think it was you our troubles did bring
But 'twas more the mischievous elves that their king.
To f3i&amp;wer3=- Sow flowerA what do yoiis want i done
The elves have harmed us just in fun	
But their king says now that they wish to repent
So if henceforth their lives be spent
In helping others their burdens to bear,
And injuring no more our flowers fair,
Well then if those terms they will obey,
We'llX let it go at that and have no more delay.
How fairies with that do you agree
Fairies nod-You do, well that I'm glad to see,
Elfin King, have you anything to say?
King - "Titania, I thmnk that is fair play
And I'm sure we'll quite eagerly follow your plan
Till soon there'll be no better elves than
Mine are going to be sweet fairy
For all their evil ways they'll bury"
Queen -  "Dear king, I'm glad your so sincere
With you for friends ysx we need never fear"
Queen then steps down from throne, fefekes king's hand and
leads him to centre of stage.  He stoops and kisses her hand.
Fairies dance around.
Curtain falls and rises showing fairies in semi-circle
around king and queen.
Queen - " So now our troubles with the elves are o'bf
And we are at peace with each other once more."

CHILDHOOD
Daddy was the engineer in charge of railways and bridges. One pretty little bridge that he had designed as well as supervised, spanned a waterway at Centre Island, close to where the ferry docked. Perhaps that is why we began to celebrate family birthdays at the island. On one such dayf before Daddy had joined us, a child fell into the lagoon near our picnic table. He couldn't swim, but Ken saw his flailing and jumped in to the rescue. His reward for heroism was the ordeal of travelling home by ferry and street car wrapped in Mother's ankle length sweater to cover his nakedness.
Mother had her embarrassing moment on the street car one day when my clear childish treble asked her if the Holy Ghost wore a white sheet. We three children all went to Sunday School, at Saint Aidan's Anglican church on Queen Street until at five years of age I suddenly became a Presbyterian. On an especially important festival morning at Saint Aidan's the Sunday school children were taken up into the church for part of their program. Lacking a hat, I was turned away at the door and sent home. Mother's reaction was to take me over to the nearest competition, Kew Beach Presbyterian Church where, she assumed, the standards would be less ridiculous. However, the time came when I returned to St. Aidan's. The janitor at Kew Beach caught me stealing a

hard candy from the big tub of them waiting to be put into Christmas stockings for the poor. I was ashamed ever to face him again, and made my own move back to join my brothers. This is my first public confession of this crime.
We had moved to the Beach the year after it had become part of Toronto. Most of its homes had begun as summer cottages. None of the side roads were paved, but urbanization was proceeding at a great pace. New houses were springing up, and Mother and Daddy were looking for one. Sunday afternoons we went exploring the half-finished homes, climbing ladders to the second floor, comparing the floor plans, checking out the number of rooms. I did my own gleaning from the rubbish piles outside, finding beautiful little ceramic insulators and small blocks of wood just right for furnishing the doll's house that Daddy had helped me make out of a wooden box. In 1917 he and Mother settled on a house to buy. We were all around the dining-room table at a meal, when Daddy told us about it. "It's in the back yard of the big white house at the corner of Balsam and Pine", said Mother. "In the back yard?" I was appalled. I took my napkin ring to represent the yard, and put a crumb of bread in it. "You mean like that?" "Not quite", said Daddy.
Indeed not quite like that, I discovered. Balsam Avenue turns at the top of the hill, and our new house, on land that was cut away from the big white house on the corner, faced down the

steep hill, and commanded a view right to the lake. Our back yard was deep enough for a pleasant lawn with a big family garden swing, and beyond that a vegetable plot for our victory garden. We were still at war. Across the fence the neighbours on the north had a lot that ran into the woods and down at the back all the way to the fourth pond. Up in the great oaks behind their house the twins had a tree loft, with a ladder up to it. And the twins were my age. What more could anyone want?
Mother was a capable woman, well able to run a home smoothly, (still with wonderful Florrie) and fling herself into all kinds of outside war work. She was organizing tag days, singing with the Mendelssohn Choir in benefit concerts, knitting "comforts for the Boys", and moving steadily up in the hierarchy of the "Daughters of the Empire", or IODE as everyone called it. She was handsome, straight, somewhat heavy, ("Am I as fat as that woman, George?"), with presence. When she walked across the room it was like watching a ship in full sail. She had a strong sense of drama. After my morning cuddle in bed with both my parents, when Daddy had vanished to the bathroom, she would tell me a fairy story, and I would be there in the big bed, watching her dress. Her long hair, after its brushing, was divided into hanks, each one tied with a shoe lace, before being twisted up into the fashionable pile on the top of her head. Meanwhile she was harrowing me with the story of Bluebeard. Her voice wavered between hope and terror. "Sister Anne - Sister Anne - is there

anyone coming?" This was my cue to burst into tears, which I did every time. We both enjoyed our parts.
We had a talking parrot in those days. On warm afternoons Polly was in the screened porch close to the street. Each man hurrying up Balsam Avenue after work was greeted with her raucus "Want a good dinner? Want a good dinner?" I liked best her self-taught imitation of Mother on the telephone. First the ring, two or three times, then "Hello?" then "Oh, Hel-lo!, rub-a-gub, rub-a-gub,rub-a-gub," long pause, then the very timbre of Mother's laughter, another pause, more rub-a-gub and eventually "Well Good-bye", in Mother's own lilt.
Mother had been a professional singer in Montreal, soprano soloist in a big church on Sherbrooke Street, when Dad fell in love with her. She had won a scholarship to study opera in England, but her parents wouldn't or couldn't let her use it. A pity. Her voice was glorious, clear, true and strong. When I was playing with the Hoods down on McLean Avenue at supper time, Mother could walk to the top of the path through the woods to call me, and her voice carried the length of a city block. Besides, she had the temperament. My regret for her is tempered by the realization that her loss was my gain. I am very glad to have been born, and to have had such a father. The memory of the frustration she suffered at losing her chance for a career in music made her completely supportive of anything that had to do with my ambition to be an artist.

Mother's family had its roots in Quebec city where Great-Grandmother Hunter had landed from Ireland, eighteen years old, a "ward in Chancery" and, so the story goes, had arrived alone and terrified at the door of a lawyer's office and had fainted into the arms of the lawyer's clerk, John Hunter. Her photograph at age eighty shows a strong Irish face, direct, confident. Of her twenty-one pregnancies only three children survived to maturity. Her one daughter, Mother's mother, married Grandpa Moffatt and moved eventually to Montreal, followed by the Hunter sons, so that by this time most of Mother's relatives were living there.
The year I was seven Mother took me to visit them all. Grandma's flat was a Victorian stage set, with antimacassars, upholstered chairs with silk swags and tassels and fringes, lace doilies, wonderful arrangements of waxen flowers inside oval glass domes. On her dressing table was a pair of little silver horses pulling a carriage made of mother-of-pearl with silver wheels. On my dining-room table seventy years later, is a silver butter dish with a silver cow lying on its lid, that I first saw on her table in Montreal. Grandfather had a stereoscope, a marvellous peep-show which you held up to look through. There was a lens for each eye offering its own version of a scene, taken from fractionally different angles. I remember best Niagara Falls, incredibly three-dimensional, and interesting to me because I knew that Mother and Daddy has started married life

there. One of Mother's favourite stories was of the day Daddy took her in a bucket down the big shaft where the water would fall eventually, water that would generate power to make electricity for all southern Ontario. He had been assistant chief engineer for that first hydro-electic development. Ken was born there, and Mother used to shop across the bridge in the States and come home with her purchases hidden under Ken's baby clothes. Daddy would have stopped that in a hurry if he had known.
Uncle Charlie Moffatt, Mother's important doctor-brother, and Aunt Mabel, his wife, were both overseas in the war. It must have been later that I visited them in a very splendid house, with a maid in a black dress and frilly white apron who served lunch, which Aunt Mabel called "luncheon".
Grandpa took Mother and me on a steamship down the Saint Lawrence River to Quebec City. There was a big flat island in the middle of the river and it had a lot of cows on it. Then we took another big boat across the river to Levis, and walked with Grandpa up a steep hill to a house that had its kitchen and its dining room in the basement underneath the parlor. Aunt Tilly and Aunt Pussy lived there with two other ladies who were their daughters, and were said to be some kind of cousins of mine. The time came when that Levis house was my stop-over on the way to the Gaspe painting ground, with one of the dear old aunties still there to welcome me, and the cousins full of interest in showing me historic Quebec.

Sometime that next winter Florrie had to leave us. She had "taken service" to help her sister and brother tide over the years while they were all waiting for their apple orchard in the Okanagan Valley to reach maturity and start bearing apples. That time had come, and she was needed out west. We never forgot her. Every Christmas she sent us a loving letter full of news of the orchard and a big box of home-made chocolates. On my bedroom wall I had her photograph in a little silver frame. When I visited her twenty years later on my first trip west/ she looked just like that photograph, but instead of the tall woman I remembered, I found a little person who came hardly above my shoulder. I don't know which of us was happier to see the other.
In the fall of 1918 there was the Sunday of the false alarm, when all the bells in Toronto rang for the end of the war, and then we found that it was not yet true. But the armistice came soon after, and I was taken uptown to the front porch of a house on University Avenue to see the Victory Parade, with broad ranks of men in khaki marching down the wide street, and everyone on the sidewalk waving flags and shouting and crying.
The incident that underlined for me the return of peace was the Sunday morning that I went in to the kitchen where Mother was getting dinner. There was a pot on the stove, tightly covered.
"Can you keep a secret?" Mother asked, and lifted the lid

	FIRST LIGHT
Chicks - running about on the ground - their bright yellow feathers sticking up in all directions - or are those the toy chicks that appeared in the shops at Easter, with wire legs that you could bend to make them stand up? Was it the toy chicks later on that reminded me of my first real fluffy chicks that ran around on the ground? Mother said the real ones must have been at Mr. Cousins1 farm outside Vancouver where we were living the summer I turned two. The gulls I remember, hanging motionless in the air as they floated behind the ferry, but turning their heads from side to side as they watched for the bits of bread someone was throwing. That could have been Vancouver, or Berkeley, California. Before we got to California we stayed for weeks in a hotel in Boise, Idaho. We were there for Christmas and for my first remembered experience of inconsolable sorrow. It was brand new. Santa Claus had brought it just that morning, a doll made of blue cloth with a celluloid head - and the little girl who lived down the hall broke it. I am still running screaming up the corridor to Mother. It is a frozen clamorous moment.
Similarly frozen, but without emotion, is my pause on the cellar stairs in the Berkeley house, conscious that it was my third birthday. Why the cellar stairs? Why do I remember that I was on my way down? What had a three-year old to do with the

cellar? Were there no presents or candles on a cake to make better memories?
Sometime that summer my father's employers went bankrupt, ending the California interlude, and Grandfather McCarthy back in Moncton was so gravely ill that Dad took us all east to the old family home to see him. The simple two-story frame house was familiar, just like its photograph that hung on the wall wherever we went. But the big poplars at the gate had been cut off at shoulder height. While we were visiting, someone took a snapshot of one of them with Dougie and me perched on top, squinting into the sun, and Kenneth, our eleven year old brother standing behind us. I suspect that we three lived, not at the old King Street home behind the poplar stumps, but at Aunt Adelaide's big house on the hill. Uncle Matthew Lodge, her husband, was a big bluff, expansive sort of uncle, whose later visits to us in Toronto were notable for the doll he always brought for me, and the pervasive smell of cigar smoke that lingered the next day. My clearest memory of the Moncton interlude is of picking green beans in the garden that covered the slope running down to the road behind their house.
Twenty years later, after my father's death, when Mother sent me back to Moncton to meet his people, it was again in the big house on the hill that I stayed. Three of his sisters were together in it. Adelaide herself, elegant, sardonic, was mistress of the house and of her dead husband's estate. Aunt

Molly, the eldest of the family, lived with her. She had been a young teacher, engaged to be married to an equally young clergyman, when Grandmother McCarthy became an invalid after my father's birth. She gave up her marriage to look after her mother and the smaller children. It was she who encouraged Dad to get an education and the first university degree in the family. She and her young clergyman wrote regularly to each other for the rest of their lives and neither married. Dad had for her a fierce loyalty, and had taught me to look on her as his real mother. She sent me Christmas and birthday presents which, I was brought up to realize, demanded a thank-you letter. Through the years we had corresponded, but even so I was unprepared for the diminutive and dynamic old lady who was at that time following avidly the radio broadcasts of the Allan Cup series. Moncton was in the hockey finals, and she knew every player by name.
The third sister, "Aunt Fon" lived with the disgrace of her daughter's un-married pregnancy twenty years before, which was as palpably present as was poor Aunt Fon herself. She took me to meet the disgraced daughter and the seducer who had been compelled to marry her. We all put on a gallant show, but it was not an exhilarating occasion. Roy's belly overhung his pants. His vulgarity was as evident as his curly red hair. Privately I thought him a fat boor, and my heart ached for both the women. The illegitimate child, a fine promising lad I was told, had been killed by a gun accident at sixteen.

Moncton was the last stop in the wanderings of the McCarthy family. By Christmas of 1914 Dad was a city engineer with the works department of Toronto and we were in a house on Sherbourne Street. One cold dark morning in November, Eaton's delivery man brought a doll's sleigh to the front door, to my delight but to Mother's dismay. I accepted her hasty explanation that it had come to our house by mistake, and I have forgotten what I thought when it re-appeared on Christmas morning. Each of Eaton's red and blue wagons was pulled by a pair of beautiful matched dappled grey and white horses. The delivery man who drove them became a friend, calling two or three times a week, bringing in the parcels without waiting to be admitted, knowing everyone's name. The morning parade of Eaton's wagons leaving the Bay street stables was one of the sights of Toronto. The beasutiful grey teams trotted up Bay Street in smooth sequence, until the ones bound east and west turned off and went their own ways. Daddy teased Mother by telling her that he took his cheque at the City Hall on pay day and walked across the street to put it in his Eatons Deposit Account. No McCarthy bought anything on credit.
Summer of 1914 saw us in a cottage at Long Branch. Now the memories crowd. Before breakfast Daddy would be over in the dewy grass of the bowling green across the road, picking mushrooms which were cooked with the bacon for breakfast. I was a fairy at the masquerade that was held by the summer residents, dressed in pink tarlatan with wings that were stiffened with a wire frame. Helen Halford was a matching blue fairy. The Halfords lived in

a cottage nearby. There was a mother and two children close to us in age, but it is Mr. Halford that I remember. When the families were visiting together he would make faces, indescribably grotesque and funny, which sent us into gales of laughter. When summer was over and both families were back in Toronto, I was allowed to make my first-ever telephone call to him. We were friends.
Florrie was with us. She was Mother's "help" who had become part of the family as far back as Vancouver, and was a second mother to us. It was she who filled the big galvanized iron tub with water for the Saturday night bath that I shared with Dougie. She read us the "Uncle Wiggley" stories that appeared every night in the "Evening Telegram" which Daddy carried home with him on the train. Was it Daddy or "Uncle Wiggley" that I was waiting for, the day that I disappeared from the house and was found sitting on the railway track?
There was a spectacular thunder storm one night, with lightning snaking down over the lake and cracks of thunder to shake the cottage. Daddy took me in his arms out on to the verandah and showed it to me, holding me tight and secure. I have not been afraid of storms since that day. And it was that summer that I recall interrupting Mother's tea party to have her pull my panties back up after I had, successfully, gone to the toilet all by myself.
It was while we were in Long Branch that Dougie came home waving a newspaper and calling out that war had been declared. I

must have had some sense of portent, perhaps caught from the way Florrie and mother talked, but the war itself I experienced much later as the reading aloud at the breakfast table of the casualty lists, and the street fairs and dances to raise money for the Red Cross.
For the first three years of the war we lived in a rented house on McLean Avenue in the Beach district, long enough to confuse the sequence of the memories. To know right from left hand I must stand again facing the kitchen window. My right is the one on the same side as the back yard. North is the house where the Arnolds lived. Mary Arnold was the little girl whose doll I stole, earning me the only serious spanking I remember. There was a second installment to that spanking when I was discovered to have lightened my banishment to Motherfs bedroom by using her nail scissors to cut off the bristles of her best silver-backed hair brush.
The happy times were legion. Birthdays took us down to Scarborough Beach Park, a wonderful place with picnic tables beside the long sandy beach, and a whole amusement park between Queen Street and the lake. There was the little train, a real steam engine pulling a string of cars behind it, each car open with seats for two, facing two more. It carried you on a twisting course through the woods that ran along the west side of lower McLean, and then out of the woods and past some of the places where you could win kewpie dolls and other remarkable

prizes. There was a Tunnel of Love notable for the little boat you sat in while you were pulled along a circuitous route in the almost-dark around corners where mirrors frightened you with the illusion of imminent collision. The Bump-the-Bumps was free, a wide slide of polished wood swelling here and there into smooth rounded hillocks that swung you off course as you were sliding down on your underpants and sometimes turned you completely around so that you arrived facing backwards. When we had played there long enough, we went down to the table beside the lake where Mother and Florrie were getting supper ready for Daddy's arrival after work. The birthday cake was the triumphant climax, a big round layer cake, iced in sections, alternately pink and chocolate, the colours separated by ruchings of icing, and adorned with the right number of candles. Becoming a year older meant something in those days!
Up the street was where Freddie Hood lived, with indeed, his older sister and mother and father. But it was Freddie who was my soul-mate. Together we explored the woods behind his house, finding mossy stumps that were obviously fairy palaces. Freddie's father was an imaginative playmate for any child, full of surprises. Easter morning at the Hoods' discovered ashy rabbit tracks on the livingroom carpet, and following them led to hidden hoards of jelly beans and even chocolate Easter eggs. Mr. Hood had made a great long bob sleigh, able to take ten of us at once, and many a winter Saturday afternoon was spent dragging it

up the steep path through the woods to where Pine Crescent beganf and careening down the long S curve and up the sharp slope at the bottom to the head of McLean Avenue, with Mr. Hood at the helm. This was before the road was paved or cars were common. There were no houses yet on the crescent and so no delivery wagons. Kenneth was eight years older than I and beyond most of the things that Dougie and I shared, but even Ken joined in that fun.
The ponds that punctuated the stream running through the ravine between Kingston Road and Queen Street were still ponds, freezing over every winter. We all learned to skate on them. There was the day that Ken skated too close to the overflow into the drain that carried the stream under Queen Street. He had been skating backwards, and fell in and down the big pipe. Fortunately for him, he was not injured, and there was enough air space to let him crawl on his wet hands and knees through the culvert to the south side of Queen Street and out again. But some of the other kids found his boots and carried them home to Mother, who jumped to the natural conclusion. It was weeks before any of us was allowed on the ice again.
The Hannah kids had a complex of tents, one leading into another, set up in the wooded lot to the south of them. It was a gathering place for the neighbourhood, and Fred and I were tolerated on the fringe, happy to be the children in the elaborate game of "house" that engaged the older youngsters. The

same gang of boys and girls of all ages played "Oyster Sails" (Hoist your Sails?), dividing into teams. Each team had to furnish a cryptic map to guide and mislead the hunters in their search for the team in hiding. Spring was when the gutters began to run melt-water and the boys brought out marbles and alleys. Girls took to skipping ropes.
My birthday came in July, allowing me to start kindergarten as soon as I had turned five. Freddie was too young to go with me but Barbara Hood made a dependable escort to get me there safely. However, I was dismissed earlier than the big girls. There was some wretched little boy released at the same time who discovered the fun of chasing me. For a few afternoons he terrorized me, until Mother found out. Then she arranged for me to be given a five minute head start. I ran all the way home every day to protect my lead. I wonder if he came to a BAD END.
To reach school we must go down a flight of steps from Pine Crescent and cross the wooden bridge that spanned the stream between the second and third ponds. The story is told, although I find it hard to believe, that one day I barred the entrance to those steps, and demanded a kiss as the price of passage.
One other isolated memory from McLean Avenue - the day Daddy went back to Long Branch away west of Toronto to get the canoe, and paddled it home to the Beach. It was an autumn morning, cold and miserable, with a mean wind. Mother was very anxious because the lake was rough and Daddy was alone. She bundled me up since I was too young to leave, and together we walked down to the

bottom of McLean and stood like something out of an old-fashioned melodrama, huddled together for warmth and comfort, straining our eyes to see above the waves. At first there was just a darker speck. But it grew, and became a something real, and eventually recognizable. Mother never did get over her distrust of canoes, but she was game to let us all learn to be at home in them.

MARJORIE
One Saturday in August of 1918 a new family moved in to the big white house next door to us. We saw the furniture being unloaded and carried up the walk, and later there was a small boy running around, and two girls. But it was not until Sunday afternoon that I had a chance to speak to one of them. A Salvation Army band had paused in front of their house on the corner of Pine Avenue and Balsam. Two "Sally Anns" in their trim navy uniforms and bonnets, and three men with instruments were giving a rousing concert of hymns, lively enough to set toes tapping and tempt you to sing along. But some rowdy boys, whom I had never seen before, were across the road, jeering and yelling at them rudely. A fair, pretty girl who seemed to be about Doug's age, came out of the big white house, and stood watching. I seized my opportunity. "Aren't they awful?" I ventured. "They're terrible", she agreed, and told me that her name was Eleanor Beer. While we were still exchanging tentative introductions, her younger sister joined us rather shyly. Marjorie and I have often regretted that neither of us could remember what we said to one another. I suspect that our deathless words were "Hello". "Hello". Years afterwards we worked out the exact date, and from then on celebrated the anniversary of our meeting as an annual thanksgiving day in our

personal calendars. There should have been a jet stream across the sky or a rainbow or some cosmic recognition of the moment. Surely the band must have struck up "Beulah Land" or something equally joyful.
At eight and nine we were still children, pleased to find someone who liked the same books, mutually in love with Anne of Green Gables and still with secret loyalty to our out-grown dolls. We were in the same grade at school but, alas, in different schools. This made Saturdays even more precious. We had picnics together on the little side porch of the big house. Marjorie's bedroom window faced mine, and we contrived a private wake-up signal to give us some time together before breakfast. We had a string, long enough to stretch from window to window, and each of us tied an end to her big toe. The first to waken after daylight gave a tug. We went to the window to acknowledge the signal, and the morning was ours!
My parents were pleased with the friendship. Perhaps I would stay home instead of always running off to McLean Avenue. Marjorie's father was a doctor who had been with the army in England and France, and Mother admired doctors, especially one who had been in the war. Dr. Beer was still in active service, but stationed in Toronto. He was called for every morning by a uniformed driver in an automobile. This was a matter of some pride, for motor cars were still so uncommon that whenever one came up Balsam Avenue everyone's head turned to watch. On rare occasions when he was needed uptown on a Saturday morning, he

would take Marjorie and me in the back seat just for the ride. The Beers found us to be good neighbours, and encouraged our growing intimacy.
We discovered an entrance to the crawl space under the verandah that ran on two sides of the big house, and we used to creep in there on our hands and knees and sit in the dark corner nearest my house, smoking dry oak leaves in acorn pipes, being tough characters called Jake and Bill. It was from that refuge that we overheard our mothers agreeing that we would both benefit from taking ballet lessons and that we should be enrolled in a Saturday morning class up at "Margaret Eaton". Our mirth at the idea of our trying to be ballet-dancers was matched by our delight at the prospect of travelling to town together every week.
We went west on the Queen Street car, and transferred to the "Belt Line" which took us up to Bloor. The cars were closed, each with a coal stove down at one end to keep it warm in winter. The conductor sat on a high perch in the centre, collecting fares. The trip was endlessly interesting, passing our own Beaches library and Kew Gardens with the real skating rink that was better than the pond, taking us past the race track where you could sometimes see horses running, past the big brick house with the wonderful garden where the Ashbridge family still lived. They had once owned all the land around Ashbridge1s Bay. We crossed the Don River and jerked along the part of Queen Street that had no gardens or trees at all, just mean little shops and a

few factories. The Belt Line ran up Sherbourne Street with its great old houses, past Allan Gardens and the very house we had lived in when we first came to Toronto.
The classes were held in an imposing imitation Greek temple on Sherbourne Street near Bloor, but we were ill equipped to serve in the sanctuary. Two more inept dancers would be hard to imagine. We tried hard, feet at right angles as demonstrated, arm from down at the side - to out - to forward - to up - "again please - smoothly dear, - don't jerk - again please", but it was a lost cause. We did not become the graceful little girls Mother and Mrs. Beer had hoped for.
Summer brought separation, eased by letters, Marjorie was taken out west by her grandmother to meet her Brandon cousins. I spent July at a table Daddy had set up under the trees, making a book for Motherfs birthday present, writing the story and painting the illustrations.
By the end of August the new house on the corner of Spruce Hill Road and Queen Street was ready, and the Beer family moved one street over and down the hill to the proper doctor's residence and office that had been built for them. Marjorie and I met or parted at the corner of Sycamore and Spruce Hill, the half way point. "See you at Syc" was the formula.
In September we were for the first time in school together, same room, same teacher, and only two seats apart. We took two other little girls into our fellowship to form the "Quartette Club", with Marjorie as president and Doris as secretary. I

think we were suffering from leadership ability and needed somebody to lead. I have forgotten the purpose of the club. We did have formal meetings and learned the rules of procedure, and we did hold a street fair on Queen Street to raise money for the Star Fresh Air Fund. We took the five or six dollars we earned up to the "Home for Incurable Children" and were taken through the hospital. I am still haunted by the image of those tots with heads enlarged to monstrous size.
In March, Daddy and Mother were called into conference with the school principal and my teacher. "Doris was idling, not being sufficiently challenged". It was recommended that I be advanced to entrance class. Once again we were separated during school hours, but together so happily at all other times that Marjorie-and-Doris became almost one word to our schoolmates. We were both instinctive actors, and loved to tease, and once that spring, we thought it would be a great joke on everyone to pretend that we had had a "fight" and were not speaking to each other. Such tiffs were a commonplace in our age group, but we knew that one between us would be an astonishment and an embarrassment to our circle. What fun! We talked it over, giggling, imagining what we would say, how we should act, and then knew that we would do no such thing. Our friendship was sacred and we could not desecrate it. That would be the sin against the Holy Spirit for which there was no forgiveness.
My advance to high school was momentous in some ways but it hardly rippled the surface of our life together. There was no

one there who could offer me what Marjorie and I shared. We both intended to become great authors, and each of us had in the works several short stories and at least one full length novel. Two weeks after I had won the Junior Oratorical contest at Malvern Collegiate, Marjorie won the Senior Oratorical at Williamson Road. We published regularly (for each other) a newspaper called Passe Don Veul, a name without meaning but with a French ring to our ears. On New Year's Day, 1922 each of us began to keep a diary. My entry for January the third reads this way.
"In the morning Miss Baker the dressmaker came so I had to be fitted and it was not till after two O'clock that I met Marjorie for the first time since the Friday night I slept with her and went skating. My skates worked fine.
"Marjorie told me the plot of her story. It was about a little girl, "Sunny of the Alley" she was called who was a little ray of Sunshine wherever she went. The other children of the alley loved her so that they made her Portly Pillar Princess, the Portly Pillar being a remnant of the alley's better days. One time when she was rescuing a dog from being ill-used a limozine drove up and she recognized the lady occupant as the owner of a picture of her "ideal" which she had cut from an old society paper.
"The lady asked her the cause of the disturbance and the bully who had been hurting the dog manfully came forward and took the blame on himself. The lady offered Sunny and her dog a ride

home and on the way became so interested in the pitiable story of her every day life that she decided to offer some help.
"After a lot of little incidents that lead up to the crisis it turns out that Sunny's mother and the kind lady are sisters and it turns out all right. Sunny and her mother become rich and move to a delightful home in the country but Sunny's favourite spot is still her seat on the Portly Pillar.
"While we talked and skated we promised eachother that we would dedicate our first sucessful attempts to eachother. I told Marjorie about Orphan Gracie and Fluff and she told me about her Vanity of Peggy. At last it was time for us to go home and we did, each greatly encouraged by the others enthusiasm".
A few weeks later, we wrote a verse play together, a modest little drama about a fairy kingdom suffering under persecution from mischievous elves. It contained some slight variety of character, a modicum of conflict, and a happy ending. Our elders were impressed, and I read in the diary, "Saturday, Jan 21. This afternoon at 2 O'clock I went down to the church and got into an awful mix-up about the play. Miss Vatcher wanted to have it, and mother had promised to give it to Miss Graham. In the end it was decided that we would let Miss Graham do it. As soon as I arrived home Marjorie came up and called for me and together we went down to Miss Grahams and showed the play to her. She thought it was very good and although I didn't catch any definite promise to put it on she mentioned drafting the parts and told us she thought little children would act much sweeter. 'I have a

little girl only four and a half years old acting,' she said. After we came out of there we went to the library and got books out."
Mrs. Graham, as I should have called her, did produce our playlet as part of a concert put on in the basement of the church to raise money towards building the "Memorial Hall".
Again I quote. "May-day - play day....I awoke this morning with a funny feeling that something was going to happen. Then I remembered - the Play - I lay in bed a while, shivering with excitement but finally getting calmer I got up."
My diary goes on with a report of the election of Barbara Hood as captain of our first form basketball team, our team practice after school, and a work-out down at Hoods' on McLean Avenue to get ready for the jumping competition for the coming Field Day. "It was twenty minutes after six when I got home. Mother showed me the flowers she had got for Mrs Graham. They were pink carnations and beautiful. Then I had supper and went upstairs to dress. At about 7.05 O'clock I was at Beer's for Marjorie. She had gone to deliver some tickets so I went to Whitelaws to wait. Marjorie called for me shortly after and we went to the church. Daddy was the only one there at first but the hall filled rapidly and before we knew it we were having trouble in saving seats. (Details of who sat beside whom.)

darling little page played too and was sweet. Reta Stone's recitations were splendid and mostly pathetic. Madeline's was very good too. Now we come to the play. (Now and play underlined twice) It all went beautifully except the king. (Irene Milton). She carried the plot of the story but spoke so indistinctly that no one heard her. After it was over, Doctor Cotton brought Mrs. Graham out onto the stage, and Miss McKann, and Margaret Watt, and a whole gang of dear little fairies came in and gave them flowers then they went out.
"Then Dr Cotton asked us to come up and the sweet darling little page came out and the funny little princess came out and gave us each a big basket of pink sweet peas and heather with a blue gauze bow and card with - find it enclosed. We were both so overwhelmed we didn't know what to say but we said something - what - will never be known. Everyone was so pleased and proud and happy. It was certainly a wonderful evening.... This day is an epoch in my life."
Marjorie's write-up covered much of the same ground and went on. "It seemed wonderful, Diary dear, to watch our xownest own' play enacted in front of our very eyes - a Castle in Spain become a reality. I've pictured this night so often at times when I daren't entertain the thought of its coming true. How lucky we are!"
How lucky we were indeed.

SILVER ISLAND
Eden to me is the ten acre island in Muskoka with the cottage that we first rented for the first time in the summer of 1922. Doug and I were involved in that rental, because Mr. Ferrier, who owned the island and spent his own summer in the other cottage there, was understood to be very particular about whom he rented it to, and was coming all the way from Mimico on the other side of Toronto, to the Beach, to look us over. Mr. Ferrier was known to be the superintendant of the Mimico Industrial School (for bad boys), a formidable person. Doug and I were instructed to call him "Sir". It is the only time in my whole childhood that I can recall being briefed about "company manners".
We were careful to be very polite to the tall stout stranger. He had brought a snap-shot showing the little cottage almost hidden by trees. And he told Mother and Daddy about the safe sandy beach and the good drinking water that you got from the well by lowering a bucket on a rope. He explained that the Supply Boat called once a week to sell fresh fruit and vegetables, and that you could get milk from the farmer who lived on the mainland when you rowed to Mortimer's Point for the mail. Eddie Mortimer had the cows, and he also had the launch that would bring us from the station. We were accepted!
The best of all was that Marjorie was coming too. Dr. Beer wanted to take Mrs. Beer to England and show her all the

places he had been to in the war, and Mother had agreed to have Marjorie as a second daughter for the whole summer. We could hardly believe in such bliss. The two mothers employed Mrs. Bennett, the enormously stout dressmaker who lived down on Spruce Hill Road with her two little white poodles, to make us "play suits". These consisted of knee-length black sateen bloomers and short black sateen tunics as shapeless as-the two little girls wearing them. They had square necklines bordered with a two inch band of coloured cretonne, pink for Marjorie, blue for me. No bride looks at her trousseau with more pride than we felt in these creations.
Dr. Beer drove Mother and Marjorie and me to the Don Station. Daddy and Doug had gone with the canoe and the trunk in Mr. Oliphant's truck, and were already there on the platform standing guard over the luggage. Daddy's two weeks of holidays were not due until August, but he was taking a weekend to see us settled and then coming back to Toronto.
My most vivid memory of the trip itself is green plush upholstery in the coach and the smell of dust and coal smoke mingled with the pungency of the sardine sandwitches and oranges that Mother had packed for our lunch. I remember also that Daddy got off the train at every stop and walked along the platform to the baggage car to be sure that the canoe was still safe.
When we got to Bala Park, Doug helped Daddy carry the

canoe down to the boat dock and we found there, among the luggage and freight piled up on the dock, ten big cartons addressed to George McCarthy, c/o Eddie Mortimer, Bala Park. Our summer's supply of groceries had arrived from Eatons. Now, if only Eddie Mortimer would come too! It was hot. We were tired and sticky after the long train trip. And there was no sign of anyone looking for us.
But the wait was not without drama. There was a lady, (dare I call her that?) sitting on one of the posts on the dock, and she was SMOKING. I was too embarrassed to stare, but there was no doubt about it. I had never before seen such a thing.
An open launch rounded the point and came towards us, with a tall lean man in the front, tanned and wind-blown. Daddy had taught me to paddle, and I was used to a canoe and a row-boat, but this was my first time in a motorboat. We watched Eddie start the engine with a crank, just like a car, and suddenly we were moving, faster and faster. Marjorie and I sat side by side squeezing each other's hand, speechless with excitement.
Half an hour later we could see ahead of us broken shapes that meant islands. "That's her", shouted Eddie above the noise of the water and the engine. He was pointing to the largest island, the one with one tall pine tree towering above all the wooded shoreline. As we came closer we saw a small dock, bright against the dark trees, and an arc of white sand curving

away from it. Soon we could recognize the little house behind the birches, and as the launch drew alongside the dock, there was Mr. Ferrier coming down a path to meet us. A skinny boy followed him, and began carrying bags and boxes off up the path before we had even finished unloading them. He disappeared with the luggage up the left fork in the path, but we were taken to the right to the Ferrier cottage to "meet Momma".
Momma was enthroned in a big wicker armchair on the porch, with two grown-up daughters in attendance. Her legs were "bad", and it was soon clear that everyone was kept running to save them. Amy was the elder daughter who stayed home and kept house. We thought "Old Maid" when we met her. Irene, who taught school, looked livelier and showed some interest in Doug as a tennis partner.
Marjorie and I were cautiously silent until the courtesies had been exchanged and we were escorted by Irene to our own cottage. Eric, the boy from the SCHOOL, had piled all our bags and boxes on the porch by this time and brought us a pail of fresh water from the well. We had arrived.
It was perfect. On one side of the livingroom was a bedroom that we promptly labelled "the harem" because Mother and I were to share the big bed, and Marjorie to use the cot. Dad and Doug made do with the little room on the other side. Behind the livingroom was the kitchen with a wood stove, and off that a

back porch big enough for the table that soon became the focus of our life. When we were not around it we were on the porch that fronted the livingroom, or in the lake.
Or exploring the island. Marjorie and I discovered the big pine that we had seen from the launch. We named it "Spy Glass" and buried at its foot a bottle in which we secreted a letter to be opened by the finder in 1937, an unimaginably distant future.
The trail to the tennis court which Irene had cleared in the centre of the island, was lined with hemlock undergrowth, fragrant. Marjorie said the smell reminded her of muffins, so it became the "Muffin Path". Beyond the tennis court the trail led to the other side of the island, and to the Other Cottage. We came to realize that Mr. Ferrier regretted ever having sold even one lot, but Marjorie and I found the widow who lived there with her teen-age son very cordial. She invited the whole family over one evening to hear our very first "tube" radio. It had a loud speaker, and we could all listen to it without earphones.
Behind the Ferrier cottage was another bay with a dock much larger that the one in front. The water was very deep around it, and Mother soon discovered that it was the place to fish. She would sit there for many a blissful hour, wrapped in her old ankle-length sweater, catching bass. Marjorie and I were privileged to clean them on the rock beside the dock, throwing

the scraps to the gulls. That was the dock that the Supply Boat came to. When we heard its horn we would run. It was not as large as the Sagamo or the Ahmic, but it was as big inside as a shop, and we would carry baskets of vegetables and fruit back to the cottage after each visit. Marjorie had been named by Mother "Queen of the Pantry", so she was in charge of stowing it all. We had a cooler, a room that had been built into the side of the slope below the cottage. It was as cold as any cave, and kept things fresh without ice. Milk we stored on the front porch, in a granite milk tin wrapped in a cloth that was kept wet by sitting it in water. Shade and wind chilled it constantly.
That was the summer that we learned to dive, spending hours in and out of the lake, groping along the sandy bottom after the metal ring we used as a lure, dumping the canoe and climbing back into it. We felt like fish. At the beginning of the summer we rowed for the milk and the mail, but by August, if the evening was calm, we were allowed to go by canoe. We came home as the sun was low, paddling towards the great early star in the south west which I still think of as "Goldie".
Doug's friend, Laurie Bullen, was up for a few weeks. The two boys, emboldened by mutual support, began paying court to "Miss Harriman", a pretty American university student who was a guest at Dunbarton, the island opposite us. They would take her out paddling, and began to wear enormous wooden keys which they had carved to tease her about her membership in the Kappa Kappa

Gamma sorority.
And then there were family games, all the pencil games we knew, and "Hearts", that poor relation of Bridge. Mother once offered a chocolate bar as a prize for the winner, but quickly withdrew the offer as she wondered if it might teach us to "gamble". The little cottage rocked with laughter. There were evenings when Mother feared that our hilarity might carry as far as the Ferrier cottage.
Marjorie and I were used to slipping into many roles with each other. One of us would assume a voice, and the other pick up the cue. Sometimes we were Bill and Jake, ruffians who lived in the mountains. Often she was "Teddy", Edward Prince of Wales, and I was a lady of the court. We were avid collectors of photographs and clippings about royalty. We played our future Us, in which we were famous authors, exchanging gossip about our latest novels and what we imagined about the world of publishing. That was the summer after our play that had been produced, had been printed in the I.O.D.E. magazine, due undoubtedly to my mother's inside track.
We read together. Marjorie had been given Anne's House of Dreams for her birthday and we read David Copperfield that summer, not aloud, but keeping up with each other so that we could "discuss" each incident and character. I remember doing Marjorie's chores for her one morning to give her a chance to "catch up".

Silver Island was in a Methodist enclave. There were famous names up and down the mainland near us, Endicott, Moore, Rogers. But since there was only one little church in the whole district and that Anglican, every Sunday evening one of the cottages became the gathering point for a "Song Service". People came in all manner of craft. Most of them left their boats at the dock and carried cushions up to the verandah, but some stayed on the water, adding what Marjorie and I considered a romantic dimension to the scene. There were hymn books enough for everyone. Irene Ferrier played an auto-harp when there was no piano or parlor pump-organ. Mother loved it, and her golden voice poured like honey over the water. As we left for home in the deepening dark, the lake was dotted with lights from the small craft going their separate ways, and Mother was still humming "Now God be with you till we meet again".
Our hopes for a second summer at Silver Island hung all spring on Ken's results. He had come home from his university exams in despair, and if he had to write a "supp" in the fall there would be no cottage for us. On Friday, June 1, 1923, I wrote in my diary. "M. and I came home from school today and, each having a lilac bloom, decided to tie it to our little bush to fool Mother. After it was fixed, I raced in calling 'Motherl have you seen the blooms on the lilac bush? louder and louder I called. When Doug's 'he haw' penetrated my skull I realized that

Mother was out. M. and I made some fudge and M. after eating some, retired and went home. That evening I was sitting on the verandah and I heard Mother who was on the phone say, ' Oh! that's the best news you could give me. Oh! we're so glad'. I just knew! I knew Ken's results were out and I knew Ken had passed. I ran into the house and it was true. I just ran upstairs and hugged all the comforters and thanked God. Oh it was wonderful. I felt so happy I didn't dare believe it. It was that forever-blessed Mr. Westman whom Ken had had for supper one night. All our terrible despairing haunting fears that he would fail or have a sup and that we couldn't go to Silver Island were groundless. WE CAN GO".
And go we did. Of the trip up, I report. "After we were comfortably settled, M started to read Christopher and Columbus. But we were interruped by Mother who was telling us that the quiet little boy sitting in the seat behind us had turned out to be the boy who was taking Eric's place.
"Mother had discovered him by admiring his lovely boxes of worms, and after asking him where he was bound for, discovered to her surprise that it was for Bala Park.
"What part of Bala Park?', she asked and he answered, 'Silver Island' .
"The Ferriers were in another carriage, and our reunion with them made the trip go quickly. What was not on that train, nor on the dock waiting for us, was the shipment of supplies from Eatons".

The next day I wrote, "M and I were washing dishes today when we heard Mortimer's launch draw up at our dock andf thinking it must be Irene we dashed out.
"To our amazement it was the BEERS
"We have never been so surprised in all our life. They packed us right in and we all dashed over to Dunbarton which the Beers just LOVE.
"There were continual goings back and forth all day and M. and I had supper over there at which we were very glad for supplies are fearsomely low over here".
The supplies arrived eventually. The goings back and forth went on all month. Doug and Eleanor swam, played tennis and paddled together, becoming friends. The families shared meals at one island or the other. Marjorie and I were ecstatic. Her grandparents came up for a visit and Daddy was with us for his holidays. I note.
"We went in swimming shortly after, and Daddy was surprised to see us dive. When I went in the second time Doug followed and Daddy, not to be outdone by us, came in too. He can dive great and that was the first time he had ever tried." Much of his time on the island was spent cutting dead trees and sawing and splitting them into firewood. The second week, we gave him an occasional hand with the job he had undertaken of painting the cottage. Dad loved work, and was a meticulous craftsman. I'm sure he had noticed the condition of the cottage himself, and made the offer to Mr. Ferrier. Both Mother and Dad prided

themselves on leaving any place better than they found it.
Seen from Silver Island, Dunbarton was a charming composition of trees, cottage and rock, set against distant shore. For the first time I wanted to tell it the way it was. Two of my paintings of it have survived. 111 painted a number of pictures of Dunbarten and they are a great improvement on last years", I wrote in 1923.
We had four summers there before Dad found a cottage to buy, in a different part of Muskoka. During the third summer Mother was struggling with ill health. She sent Marjorie and me, Doug and his friend Harvey Graham, up with a chaperone, our beloved music teacher and friend, Eleanor Baskerville. "Aunt Nell" was a tiny hunch-backed woman who had been Marjorie's homeroom teacher in her last year at public school. She was full of play, and gave us a merry fortnight before Mother came up to take over. The last summer at Silver Island, I had to be content with someone else as my special companion. Marjorie was out west experiencing for the first time the joys of a girls' camp. Life changed. There were new worlds.
It was almost fifteen years later that Mrs Beer, now widowed, rented a cottage near the one Dad had bought, and the two families shared a summer in a different part of Muskoka. Marjorie and I left her husband and baby girl, and took off together to paddle the twelve miles or so back to Silver Island. We paused at the Ferrier's cottage for the courtesies, as we had

on our first arrival, then went up the familiar path to Spy
Glass, and scrabbled in the mulch of pine needles and earth at the foot until we found it.
It was still there, safe in a screw-top jar, the note we
had written in that golden past. We laughed at it of course. We
had already carried the treasure away from the island and would have it with us for the rest of our lives.

GROWING
One Sunday afternoon when I was eleven, Daddy invited me to come with him for a paddle on Lake Ontario, and to pack a supper so that we could go a bit further than if we had to be home for tea. I leapt at the chance - my first time with the full responsibility of being his bow paddler, and the full privilege of his companionship. The canoe was kept in a boathouse at the foot of Fernwood Park Avenue, but we had to bring the paddles and cushions from home as well as the basket that Mother had packed for our picnic. I was proud to be lifting my end of the canoe down from the rack and helping to carry it across to the water's edge to launch it.
There was very little wind, hardly enough for the one or two sail boats that were out in the lake beyond us. We paddled east, with the sun behind us, past the Balmy Beach Canoe Club, past the Fallingbrook area which was still all wooded, past the Hunt Club which had for us such glamorous memories of Christmases past.
Daddy and Mother and Kenneth used to be invited to a big family Christmas dinner there every year. Grandma Moffatt's cousin was married to Captain Trowell who was the Secretary, and who had the privilege of using the club house and staff for his own Christmas party. For the last two years before he retired, Doug and I had been considered old enough, and had been included.

There had been a baronial dining room, a table to seat thirty, silver shining, glassware sparkling, a huge fire blazing on a hearth at one end of the room. For me, the two most exciting features had been the row of waiters in uniform, standing behind us, and ginger ale to drink, as common as milk. The first year that I was invited, I drank the ginger ale so eagerly that I had room for nothing else. The next time saw me wiser, and I was able to last even to the marvel of the Baked Alaska, an undreamed-of sophistication. Daddy danced with me after dinner, and Ken once, and big Harry Trowell, and there was a Paul Jones to mix everyone up, and the older ladies and gentlemen were in another room playing cards. Afterwards, for the McCarthys, there was a long walk home in the snowy cold, upheld by the excitement of the whole wonderful Christmas that lay behind us.
Beyond the Hunt Club, Scarborough Bluffs became bare and sculptural, eroded into sharp peaks, and cut with ravines. In those days there was no Bluffers' Park, no marina, no land except the narrow strip of beach, and we paddled close to the shore, watching for birds. We came at last to the remains of the old lake freighter, the "Alexandra", that had foundered at the end of the war in a violent autumn storm. Rumour claimed that she was worn out and heavily insured. She ran aground and broke up, and her cargo of canned goods, minus their labels, was washed up and strewn for most of a mile along the shore. Ken and some of his friends had ridden out on their bicycles, salvaged a few tins and brought them home. Now, all that was visible was the round top

of the boiler and part of a funnel. Gulls flew from it as we paddled towards it. We circled it curiously, then agreed to land on the beach near it, where a deep ravine came down to the shore.
We had our picnic there on the sand, building a little fire just for the fun of it. When the sun had dropped behind the top of the bluffs, and the air grew cooler, we packed up and took to the water again, far enough out from shore to feel the sun's warmth as we paddled home. It was the first time I had known my father as a friend.
This was the fall that I entered high school. Doug was already at Malvern, and although Ken was now at university in Pre-Meds, he was well remembered there. When he was in third form, Mother had been out on the front lawn sweeping up leaves one afternoon when Mr. Graham, the chemistry teacher, came down the street on his way home.
"Good afternoon, Mrs. McCarthy. Would you like to know where your son is?"
"Well, where is he then?"
"He is in the chemistry lab, down on his hands and knees scrubbing the floor. I wish I could hang him from the ceiling too."
"Whatever happened?" asked Mother. Mr. Graham laughed. "He tried an independent experiment with some chemicals in his ink-well, and he's cleaning up the results of the explosion".

The blue splotch was still on the ceiling when Doug and I graduated, but poor Mr. Graham was killed by an automobile as he was crossing the street towards the school, the year that he was my home form master. It was my first personal contact with death. He was old (probably in his fifties), with silvery hair, but we had respected and liked him and we were all shocked. It was his wife who had directed our play at St. Aidan's, and his son Harvey was Doug's friend. Mother moved down into the Graham house to help Mrs. Graham through the days before the funeral. It was still the custom to set up the open casket in the living room, marking the front door with a wreath hung with purple or black ribbon, and to receive friends and neighbours at home. On one of those days Mother asked me to bring something down to her. I have forgotten what it was, but I have never forgotten my cold horror when she asked me if I would like to come in and "see Mr. Graham?" I couldn't speak. I shook my head and turned back up the hill, blinded with tears, not of grief but of terror at the thought of looking at a dead person.
Less dreadful than death to me, but more mysterious, was birth. Mother had prepared me for menstruation by a little talk one day when I was home from school and in bed with a cold. She explained that when a woman was married, God planted a seed in her which grew to be a baby, and that the womb had to be kept ready for this great event by a monthly house-cleaning. However, after the summer when the Beers were at Dunbarton across from

Silver Island, Marjorie was allowed to tell me the secret she had nursed since June, that Mrs. Beer was going to have another baby. Marjorie was thrilled. When I talked to Mother about it, she said she thought it was "disgusting!" "But Mother", I protested, "You said you couldn't help it if you were married".
"You can help it if you want to", said Mother stiffly.
Marjorie and I spent many hours that autumn, wondering to each other how it all happened, and how the baby got out. Eventually her doctor-father put into her hands "Men, Women and God", a book that told us the facts at long last, and convinced us that life was even more wonderful and beautiful that we could have imagined. Poor Mother. It is a great pity that she didn't have such a book when she was young. Poor Daddy too. It must have been rough being married to a beautiful, spirited girl with twisted Victorian ideas about sex.
Kenneth was a clever cartoonist who drew for me, in an exercise book, silly pictures of such topical subjects as "Doris practising the piano", himself executing a whirl-about on skates, a golfer all twisted up in his clubs. I then painted them. He was studying medicine, but spending too much of his time being art editor of "The Goblin", a magazine published by the students. He was also in the thick of "Daffydill Night", an annual evening of skits put on by the Faculty of Medicine. We attended as a family, proud of his prominence if somewhat doubtful of the quality of the undergraduate humour. Ken resigned out of all these distractions at the end of his fourth year, and settled

down to hard study. By this time he was "getting serious" with Bettyf whom he had taken out all through high school and kept in the field even while he took out other girls in college. Betty Caswell was a neighbour, and had become a librarian at the Beaches Library. We all loved her, and found her easier to know than Ken. But we didn't betray him on the day that Betty came with us across to Niagara on the Cayuga, while Ken was a deck steward on it and had one of his other girls on board. He managed to keep the two girls on different decks and do his job too. He did some fancy footwork that day.
Betty gave me my first paid job, a session after school sorting books and replacing them on shelves, rewarded with an envelope containing my wages, twenty-five cents. I kept that coin for a long time. It was too precious to spend. Much the same feeling must have moved Dad to ask for his first pay in gold, and then to have it made into Mother's wedding ring.
While I was at Malvern, Dad took me one night to hear Jack Miner and see slides of the refuge for Canada geese that he had established at his home in Kingsville. Dad was one of the early conservationists. He belonged to an organization called "Men of the Trees", dedicated to planting rather than cutting. The McCarthys never had a Christmas tree. A row of stockings along the fireplace was our substitute.
More surprising, in retrospect, was the night that he invited me, at the last minute, to the Royal Alec to see Walter Hampden in Hamlet. We got the last two seats in the house, at

the end of the last row in the gods. What a performance! The audience was spellbound, and I felt that I had discovered a new dimension of my father.
Doug and Eleanor were ahead of us at Malvern and part of a group of young people that gave grown-up parties to which Marjorie and I, as younger sisters, were sometimes invited. This group became very good friends and began pairing off by the time they were in Fourth Form. When the school dances were held they were already in couples. Not so with Marjorie and me. In our crowd there was tremendous ferment for weeks ahead, with speculation as to who would invite whom, and much secret anxiety. No self-respecting girl made the advances, at least according to Mother. If an invitation was proffered, awkwardly during some chance encounter as the classes passed each other in the hall between periods, or at noon hour during the brief lunch break, the level of anxiety stepped up sharply. What to wear? How to dance without falling all over his feet? What to talk about?
The conventions demanded that the boy call for his girl and walk her to the dance. Once there, he was responsible for filling her programme. These programmes were folders decorated with ribbons of the Malvern colours, red and black, and printed inside with twenty numbered lines, one labelled "supper dance". The lad who "took" you, put his name in the first, last and supper dance slots, and while you were greeting the other girls

in the "Ladies dressing room", powdering your nose yet once again, putting in time, he did his best to find seventeen friends willing to dance with you. Of course they traded. "You give me one and I'll take one of yours". If he returned to me before the first dance still with many blanks on the program, I wanted to die. Instead, I kept the bright smile on my face and with body as tense as my emotions, held out my arms to receive him. We danced with my hand on his shoulder, his around my back to guide me, and our other two hands clasped and held stiffly out to the side.
"I'm sorry", as one of us stepped on the other's foot. "Oh, that was my fault". I suppose we did sometimes have other things to say to each other. I made a tremendous investment in a school dance. My hair would be "marcelled" for the occasion, and I would be in my very best sleeveless silk dress, belted fashionably around the hips, bust as flat as binding could make it. By the time I was in third form, and being invited, the short skirts of the early twenties were lengthening. At least I was spared the former agony of wondering if the tops of my stockings and my garters were showing at the back when I raised my arms. This was long before panty-hose. There was a brief-lived fashion that year of wearing a bright little silk handkerchief held by a ribbon tied around the ankle.
What a relief when my partner was Laurie. He was as familiar as a brother, and kidded while he danced. Giggling at his sallies eased my tension for the moment. Supper came as a

welcome break, with other girls and their partners to share the talk. I envied Beth whose hair was naturally curly, and whose poise seemed equally natural. The misery of not being invited to the dance was equalled only by the misery of trying to live up to its demands.
The walk home was better because it was apt to be in gaggles of couples whose ways lay together. And there was no thought of good-night kisses or of inviting him in to prolong the ordeal. We had both "had a lot of fun, thanks very much". Sometimes Mother had been there as a chaperone among the row of adults parked on chairs along the edge of the dance floor. When I came in, she was predictably critical of the music, of the way the boys danced these days and of my hair. School dances are among the few nightmares of my youth.
The first year we took holidays in the old cottage Dad had bought, he and I re-shingled the roof. We rowed the three miles across Lake Muskoka to Milford Bay, where the sawmill was, loaded the whole supply of cedar shingles into the rowboat, until there was hardly an inch of freeboard at the gunwale, and so home, Dad at the oars, Doris high in the stern, paddling and keeping the boat straight. It was much later that we learned that we had been a sensation to the boys at the mill. I think they expected to see us afloat, each clinging to a bundle of shingles. The fortnight spent on the roof working with Dad is one of the best memory of my teens. He was a good craftsman, knowing all the

professional devices for making the roof weather-tight, and keeping the rows uniform and true. We were up there by nine in the morning. Mother would come out in to the sunshine and hang up a washing, with a word of praise for our progress, and some consultation about lunch. She used to buy fresh stewing lamb from the local farmer, and throw in with it onions, carrots, potatoes, whatever, until she had a fine big potfull which she hoped would last for a couple of days. Dad and I would come down ravenous and polish it off.
By four in the afternoon I had had it, and climbed down for a swim and a leisurely removal of slivers from my poor legs and seat. How those shingles splintered! Dad stayed up until he was called for supper, and sometimes put in another hour or two before dark. I used to marvel at his will to stay with it. Now I know, myself, the pull of a job like that. When I built my own house on Scarborough Bluffs I would be still working when I could no longer see what I was doing.
We promised ourselves a holiday together when we had made the cottage habitable, a week's canoe trip with a tent somewhere, perhaps down the Moon River to Georgian Bay. I think it is the only promise that Dad broke in his whole life.

CANADIAN GIRL IN TRAINING

Even now, sixty years later, I am not sure how objectively
I can look back on the teens. Rapture was commonplace, and although I seldom experience the same intensity of joy now, nothing in my life since then denies the reality of the emotions of those days, or the truth of the insights we learned. Marjorie came back from her camp in the Okanagan with stars in her eyes and a vision of girls around the world joining hands in a fellowship of love and understanding. She was in love with the leader who had shown her this dream and with the teen-agers who had shared it with her. She had became part of the Canadian Girls in Training, CGIT. This was a Canada-wide experiment that the churches were making in the belief that a small group of girls with an adult leader, who would study the Bible together on Sunday, and work and play together during the week, could find out what Christianity was all about, and how to live it.
Marjorie's home church was Beech Avenue Methodist Church, and she was soon deeply involved in its CGIT. I was on the edge, getting to know the other members of her group and painting scenery for their production of a Christmas play. Marjorie was soon on the council that linked all the Toronto groups, making new friends among the girls and the leaders she met there.

Normandale, on a cliff above Lake Erie, was a big field rising to a long hill that held the wooden dining pavilion, known as the "shack". Further along the hillside was "Round Top", the treed knoll where we sat on the grass for worship services and study groups. On the other side of the dining hall was a tall flag-pole, with space around it for all sixty of us to stand in a circle for the morning ceremonial of flag-raising and saying
together the Salutation to the Dawn.

Look to this day
For it is life, the very life of life.
In its brief course
Lie all the verities and realities of your existence.
The bliss of growth,
The glory of action,
The splendour of beauty.
For yesterday is but a dream
and tomorrow is only a vision,
But today well lived
Makes every yesterday a dream of happiness
And every tomorrow a vision of hope.

From the hillside we looked down to the L-shaped row of twenty white tents shining in the morning sun. The sun shone more brilliantly at Normandale than anywhere else in the world. God was among us. We separated after flag-raising and each of us went by herself to some special spot she had chosen for "Morning Watch", the twenty minutes of solitude with a little book that helped you to find ways to think about God and say "thank You" for the love and beauty surrounding you. Through all the fun, the meals punctuated by song, the shared interests and delights of the day, you knew that you were united in loyalty to the best and highest that you could imagine. And the daily Bible study was a chance to stretch your imagination to glimpse what Jesus meant when he talked about the Kingdom of Heaven. For ten days we tasted the sweetness of the Presence of God.
This period between the two great world wars was in some ways unique. We sincerely believed that the 1914-18 horror had been a "war to end war", and that the League of Nations was the new way for the world to settle all disputes. Just as the nineteenth century had abolished slavery forever, so the twentieth had ended war. Mother's generation had achieved the vote for women, so that universal suffrage was taken for granted. Canada was a peaceful country where men, women and even children could walk safely in the day and at night. We had grown up in "Prohibition", and alcohol was not a factor in our lives. "Bootlegging" was a word only. The twenties in my experience

were not roaring, whatever their subsequent reputation. The loving atmosphere of the home I grew up in was normal among my neighbours and school friends. Evil I knew as thoughtlessness, selfishness, complacency and laziness. I prayed sincerely to be delivered from them.
Jealousy, which I recognized as a sin, was probably my greatest temptation. Marjorie's world was expanding daily, bringing her close to national and provincial leaders, young women of god-like glamour to us all. Marjorie loved them at sight, and was able to express her love with such spontaneous simplicity that they in turn welcomed her into their personal lives as well as into their work. There were times when I felt that she had left me far behind. We both complained that "we never saw each other". Early in the spring we had planned an "Adventure" for after camp, a week together in the country, reading, walking, catching up. Aunt Nell Baskerville had found us a farmhouse to stay at, and the arrangements were all made. But it was while we were still at camp that the blow fell. I wrote about it afterwards.
"Wed. morning just before breakfast M said she wanted to speak to me and as I was taking a middy up to the shack she came with me and told me that Miss Macpherson had offered her a scholarship to a camp down in Wisconsin - and she didn't know what to do. Such a mess as that put us in. In my heart I was almost praying that her family wouldn't let her go although I

tried so hard to be unselfish and wish that they would for her sake. I think the hardest thing I have ever done is urging her to go. We had a long walk yesterday. Mother of course is disgusted, especially whenever she thought of Connie's offer (a job I had turned down), and when Marge came up she told her how mean she thought it was. I couldn't stop her but I feel very badly about it. Poor Marge. And I couldn't help, the way I wanted to. Everytime I wanted to say something I'd cry like a baby and not be able to speak. I only hope M is big enough to forgive Mother and forget it if she can. We went down to Glen Manor and up through the woods and talked of everything but our Adventure. I simply couldn't talk about that without crying and perhaps M couldn't either".
Marjorie went off to Wisconsin, and I wrote to her instead of in my diary. Her letters healed my hurt. "That first dear letter of hers is more precious than I can express".
The autumn brought the tremendous excitement of my new life as an art student. But Normandale was vividly with me and I could not keep to myself the vision I had found there. I wanted to start CGIT at St. Aidan's, and after my second summer as a camper I was able to get Dr. Cotton's permission to invite the Sunday School class I had been teaching to become a CGIT group. There were about ten of them, boisterous, giggling, irresponsible twelve-year olds, with one or two a bit older, and one who sneaked in under the age line at eleven.

She giggled like the others, but was mature enough to understand the goals.
I look back on those first three years of our group life as a hectic time in which Tuesday evening came rushing along with unnatural frequency. It was always Tuesday evening! And that meant a dash through dinner, a hasty gathering-up of equipment and a fast walk down to the church, the straggling in of the noisy, teasing kids who happened to turn up that night, an hour of shrieking "fun" playing basket-ball in the gym, and eventually Barbara's attempts to settle them down for a discussion of whatever was on the agenda. The "project method" demanded that the girls themselves plan, carry out and then evaluate their activities, and I was young enough to take such a pattern seriously. It was a washed out dish-rag that trailed back up the hill after those meetings, until -
Until the spring of our third year, when someone, who may have been sick of hearing about Normandale, suggested that we could have a camp of our own on the May 24th holiday. Marg Cook offered to ask her parents if we could borrow their cottage at Orr Lake. Someone else knew a man who worked for a lumber company and might have a truck that could take us up there. We started talking menus amid many hilarious suggestions for cost-cutting. We began listing equipment needed, and personal packing "musts". Suddenly it was time to go home. Next Tuesday couldn't

come too quickly. I was strict about keeping camp out of our Sunday Bible study sessions, but we sat around afterwards talking over the plans.
It happened. Fifty years later we still laugh over the discovery that the bundle Doris Amson was sitting on in the truck was the box of bread, now well compacted, and that it was Marg herself who slept alone in the one big bed in the cottage, while the rest of us took turns on the cots and the floor. We sang all the way up, most of the time there, and again on the long weary bumpy drive home. And when we met again on Tuesday next we hugged each other and laughed and hugged each other and sang, and were a group at last. True to schedule, we then sat down together to "evaluate" the weekend, which meant going over the details again, laughing at the way things had happened, planning the improvements we wanted next time, and parting good friends.
We found other locations for camps, one on Scarborough Bluffs closer to home. By this time I was teaching and had my first car, but was still a green driver, and turning too sharply into the laneway I put the front wheel over the culvert into the ditch. The poor little car hung there, one wheel in space. But co-operation is the essence of group life. Even teen-age girls, if there are enough of them, can lift the front end of a car and put it back on the road. We unpacked and "made camp". Later in the day Betty's father drove his daughter out. Turning in the lane, he did the same thing and ended with one wheel hanging over

the ditch. One of my good memories of that camp was his face when the girls came running and without pause or consultation lifted him back on to the road.
Once they had become campers, I knew the joys and had few of the headaches. As the years went by the older girls graduated into leadership and formed groups of their own of the younger teenagers at the church. The weekend camp in May became an annual event, including the younger groups, growing until there were over fifty girls and four or five leaders. We did our share in inter-church activities, and many of us went on to provincial leadership camps, Beausoleil Island in Georgian Bay or Beau Rivage among the islands in the St. Lawrence. What a pleasure to wake up in a bedding roll under the trees, to sit up and see across the grass the tousled heads of Edie and Madeline, two of my "own children", emerging from their bedding rolls, ready for another day of the shared heights.
In the early twenties campers sang popular songs or parodies of popular songs, pretty shoddy stuff. Jessie Macpherson changed that. She was Ontario's secretary, "Big Chief" to a generation of girls, and she cared about quality in music. Soon she had us singing folk songs, Negro spirituals, sea chanties, and anything else that was singable and worth learning. The change in music worked upwards into the University as campers graduated into the Student Christian Movement. By the time

Jessie became the innovative and adventurous dean of women at Victoria College of the University of Toronto, she had already revolutionized undergraduate sing-songs.
But by far the most important cross-fertilization was an influence that came from the university down into CGIT. Dr. Henry Burton Sharman was a radical and inspiring teacher from the States who shook up the thinking of a generation of students. He introduced a method of Bible study based on the same kind of close textual examination that was becoming common in literary criticism. He asked the young people to leave their theological ideas at the door, and read the gospel stories with an open mind. He had published a study guide which offered searching questions and provided no answers. This was used in the camp study groups. We had to find our answers in the texts, to compare the accounts of the life of Jesus in the four gospels, and to ask why they were sometimes the same and sometimes different. I began to realize how it was that the disciples, ordinary, rough, working men, Jews, who had met Jesus and got to know him as a man, came to believe that he was more than that, unlike what they had expected and yet the true fulfillment of all their hopes. For the first time in my life I understood how the disciples and the early church had struggled to find language to say what they had come to feel about Jesus. After meeting the man I could return to the language of the church and find it full of meaning. Even the theological words of the creed made sense, especially with

some judicious personal re-interpretation. Miracles had been difficulties. I remember the liberation I experienced the day Jessie Mac, "Big Chief", discussing the feeding of the five thousand, admitted to us that she thought it quite possible that after the young lad offered his loaves of bread and five small fishes, everyone dug into his pocket and pulled out the bit of cheese, the fruit, the leg of chicken or whatever was buried there, and that the real miracle was the joyful sharing that Jesus inspired. Just as when he said to the sea of Galilee "Peace, be still", it was the panic of the disciples that subsided, and that they remembered afterwards as a sudden stillness of the waves.
The great gift of those camps was being able to sing the emotion, to ritualize the love that we felt in the camp circle. One ceremony that was used very often was a torchlight service, with fire as a symbol of God's holy spirit. On the last night, after the sing-song, the games, the final announcements or whatever, each camper was given a bullrush torch. The first one was lit from the central campfire, and carried back to the circle to light the next, and the light passed from torch to torch, while we sang the first verses of the hymn "0 Love that wilt not let me go". We were a flame-brightened circle of earnest faces against the night.
0 Light that followest all my way,

I yield my flickering torch to Thee; My heart restores its borrowed ray, That in Thy sunshine's blaze its day May brighter, fairer be.
As this verse was being sung each camper in turn laid her torch back on the central fire, and the circle joined hands for the last time to sing "Taps".
The drop down from the heights into real life on the return from camp was harsh. But every camper with whom you had shared the exaltation was a friend, and a reassurance that the heights had been as real as the bumps on the lower road.

ART SCHOOL
When I was in my last year at Malvern I went every Saturday morning to the Ontario College of Art to what they called the Junior Course, a sort of introductory experience for high school students. I don't think anyone at the college tried to teach us anything. They were talent-spotting. We were encouraged, rather than taught, which I found disappointing. The only light I gained from those Saturday mornings was the difference between warm and cool colour. Miss Coombs, who was left in charge of the class after Mr. Lismer had given us the pep talk of the day, suggested to me that the grey I had used was "too cool". I looked my bewilderment, and she explained that first fragment of professional vocabulary.
At the end of the term, early in May, the College held an assembly for all the students and their parents and friends, at which time the walls would be hung with the best work of the year, and the "results" would be announced. I was hoping to be one of the Juniors chosen to take a second year of Saturday morning classes. Mother and Dad came with me, and were pleased to find that two of my paintings were up on the wall.
We were all directed to the big upstairs drawing studio, where the plaster statues of Venus and Hercules had been pushed back against the wall, and the shabby old wooden chairs arranged

in neat rows. We were early (a McCarthy trait), and chose seats close to the front. Before long the room was full, with students and even some parents standing against the wall at the back. George Reid, the Principal, welcomed the guests with a rather prosy speech. Then Arthur Lismer, who was vice-principal, talked about the Saturday morning classes, and made characteristic sly jokes about young people becoming artists, and went on to announce that the one full-time day scholarship had been won by Miss Doris McCarthy. I sat there stunned. I don't know what was done or said for the rest of the evening.
Mother and Dad were pleased but somewhat taken aback. They accepted me as talented, but we had all expected that I would go on to university and teach English in a high school, perhaps writing eventually. Since I was still just fifteen, too young for entering that stream, next year had been a big question mark. By the end of the long streetcar ride home to the Beach the decision had been made. I was to go to the art college in the fall.
"Oct.8,1926 We are actually started. I seem to be getting along quite famously so far. I love my teachers. Mr. Lismer is just the same - perhaps a little less odious in his jokes, but he hasn't lost his baffling attitude of being amused at the whole world and at us in particular...I don't seem to see any prospects of a kindred.

"Oct. 23. M and I went for a walk out the Kingston Rd. and walked past the little house I sketched last spring up to the railway crossing and there we camped in the lovely grassy field just east of the rd. to Dentonia Pk. We lay in the crisp dry brown grass and looked at the sky and dreamed that it was spring - and every once in a while we would jump up and wave at a train as it passed, It was so satisfying! I was telling her all about the students1 supper last night when I sat beside Mr. Lismer and suffered horribly from nerves at having him help me to butter and potatoes. But it was quite thrilling watching him draw Mr. Hahn who was right opposite me, on the tablecloth. It was so jolly and informal. Mr. Lismer had us in fits with his jokes and puns, (eg. celery - sellery). He has a remarkable brain for seizing puns and can never resist them. But he fascinates me. I just love to watch and listen to him talk. His little eyes are so beady and when he makes a joke they peer this way and that and twinkle to see if we're laughing".
"Nov. 19 ...I have never been so happy in my life - every minute is just another beautiful deep gratitude - 'My cup brimmeth over' Surely nobody in all the world has as much - so full a life as I - I love Monday - because Mr. Lismer usually gives us a criticism and sometimes a lecture. I love Tuesday -because it's modelling - I'm wild about Wednesday because Mr. Lismer gives us such wonderful lectures and Museum study is opening a new world of ideas and ecstasy to me, and I always have a nice walk with Tilly - and an extra sleep in the morning.

"I love Thursdays - because we have modelling again. Friday is the climax of the week because we have our happiest drawing classes and then Composition - the finale - the most looked-forward-to period of the week - when we have wonderful lectures -and both Miss Coombs and Miss Patterson!!! Then best of all the students1 suppers - and Mr. Lismer's silly kiddish -clever jokes and his humour and friendliness - and Mr. Hahn's -and Mr. Stansfield's giggle - and poor Johnfs feeble speeches and lots to eat.
"0 God! How wonderful!"
There was an older woman in the first year with us, Edna Breithaupt, from Kitchener. She offered her cottage on the Grand River near Kitchener as a headquarters for a sketching house-party at the end of term. About twelve of us were able to go, and we engaged Yvonne McKague to be our resident teacher. She was Arthur Lismer's assistant at the College, and one of those rare people whose presence turns the lights on. Red-haired, and and with the temperament that is supposed to go with that, she gave vitality and laughter to the fortnight.
Before the Kitchener trip we had been shocked by the news of Lismer's resignation from the college. The tension between him and the principal was no secret, and had become intolerable. The Kitchener gang, encouraged by Edna Breithaupt, decided that without him the college would be hollow, and that they would

rather have his teaching than everything else the school offered. They formed themselves into the "Toronto Art Students League", rented the small house that stood in the corner of Grange Park, and began a regime of self-run classes.
I longed to be with them. I had won further scholarships, complete tuition for the following year, but my heart was with the League. Dad and I talked it over. He left me to make the decision, but helped me to realize that if I ever wanted to teach art in the school system, my degree from the college would be important. I went back to go on with my course, although feeling that the life had gone out of my old world.
But I had not known that Ethel Curry would be appearing at the college after an interval away, and entering the second year. She was a wisp of a girl from Haliburton, eight years older than I, quiet, self-contained, a "lass with a delicate air", beautiful. The McCarthys had once spent a holiday at Robertson's boarding house on Lake Kashagawigamog, near Haliburton, and Ethel knew the Robertsons, and immediately shared for me the glamour of that wonderful fortnight. We became friends. She had a room on St. George Street and a talent for homemaking. A fire in the old Victorian fireplace, the rented furniture transformed with coloured throws and cushions, candles and flowers, made it a gathering place for the serious students. Many of our classmates seemed to have no sense of responsibility and were content to fritter away the days, but there were some hard-working, creative

people with us, and we began to do things together after class. We saw every play that came to Toronto, from the cheapest seats, and went to the free concerts at Convocation Hall at the University. And we talked long over Curry's coffee and sandwiches.
The next year Ethel invited me to spend the Christmas holidays painting with her at Haliburton, and with Mother's and Dad's co-operation it was decided that I should take the train up the day after Christmas. What an experience! I changed at Lindsay to a "mixed" train, one passenger coach and a couple of freight cars, which ambled up the track, stopping for leisurely unloading at funny little stations and even at cross-roads. Although I had left the Danforth station before nine, by noon we were only at Kinmount. The Conductor-cum-trainman-cum-baggage-man advised me where I could get some lunch in the village, and while I was still eating my boiled egg there, sent a youngster to tell me that the train was ready to leave "whenever you have finished, Miss."
It was dark when we reached Haliburton. I emerged from the smelly green plush coach with its dim oil lamps into a snowy world of sharp cold and brilliant stars. Waiting for me was a horse and sleigh, with Curry's mother, a round bundle of shabby fur coat below a woollen bonnet, perched on the driver's seat.

It was like stepping back fifty years. The Curry house had electric light, but water was gravity fed from a cistern upstairs which had to be filled by a hand pump in the kitchen. Too enthusiastic an attack at the pump brought water pouring down the kitchen wall from above. Hung up in the back shed was the frozen carcass of a buck, shot in hunting season, ready for butchering piece by piece as needed. Down in the cellar was the wood furnace, and the long wall of cut wood to keep it fed. Curry and I made a work space there, with our backs kept warm by the furnace, and a strong blue bulb hung from the ceiling to give us "daylight" for finishing the oil panels that we brought home every morning and afternoon.
Besides the wood in the cellar was an incredible collection of boots, rubber boots, overshoes, old coats and sweaters, mittens, hoods, scarves, snowshoes etc. If you needed something, just look for it. It was there. Curry's father, Mr. W.R., was a man of parts, owner of the only garage in town, closed, like the roads, until spring, reeve of the village, local undertaker, district inspector of roads, owner manager of the livery stable that had horses for the doctor and for anyone else who needed winter transportation, and above all a gentle man, at home in the woods, in the kitchen, at the hockey rink, and at the dance at the town hall on New Year's Eve. There, I was introduced to square dancing with a genuine resident fiddler, and a procession of good-looking young lads whom Curry identified as

the "primmers" she had taught in her first days as a public school teacher.

Curry gave me her world, the winter woods full of animal tracks, the snow fanning from the stump fences in drifts of sculptural purity, the log homes and the tar-paper shacks with blue wood smoke in curls above them. We painted every day all day, usually within walking distance of home, finding material in the village itself, along the river, down at the sawmill or out on the frozen lake looking back at the hills.
But not always. "Dec. 29. The end of a perfect day. It began fairly early with the words 'sleigh ride' that woke me with a jump. Ethel and I giggled, dressed, and ate hastily, and then packed into the cutter, too stuffed amd bundled for action of any kind. I loved the motion of the horses, the crispness and tingle of the air - and the sideways skidding of the sleigh, up slowly -
along smartly, bells jingling - nose running - mind happy -playing with thoughts of Marjorie and Jessie.
"We saw some lovely bits of colour - a blue door - and a pink and grey one - and some gay washings hung out to dry. The last few miles were through a wild bit of wood - rough uneven trail - hardly a road - twining black birches and elms tangled up in saplings and underbrush. There were three patches where the road was sunk in black bog and the horses would hardly take the jump across. I thought that the sleigh would break and deposit us in the mud or else that it would stick there forever.

Arriving at camp (one of Mr. Curry's lumber camps) was an adventure too. We sat down at one of the big long tables and ate gustily from tin plates, drinking out of big tin bowls. But the climax, more thrilling even than the cutter part, was the walk over the lake, dazzling in sunlight, Ethel and the men ahead, picturesque in breeches and windbreakers, casting vivid shadows, and the hills around the lake. I loved the keen wind, the feel of the snow under my feet, and especially the sense of high adventure.
"Then for the drive home I cuddled low against Ethel -casting a submerged eye over the rugs at the heavenly colour -bright mauve sunlight on hills, a wonderful afterglow - Venus, and later Mars and Jupiter - golden light on trees, a barn with the bright sky shining through."
"Jan.2 Yesterday it snowed heavily, and left the village in a quiet hush - all contours softened - all harshness covered -
only a brooding peace and mystery. Our walk to the rink was indescribably lovely. The stars in a black-blue sky were brighter than ever before - and the street lights made circles of cold yellow light - accented by the tenderly blue-purple shadows between them. Footprints across the snow made me ache with their beauty. Every step sent a little shower of powdery flakes into the air. The blacksmith's shop was a perfect composition - dark against a still darker sky - roof and snow gleaming dimly - and a lovely pattern of light, fan-shaped on the snow from the two

windows in the front. It was 25 below zero, so cold that my nose twitched and was stiff, and our breath froze in white frost on our hair. The stars were bright and the smoke rose quietly straight up, meeting as it slowly spread into one smoky pall that caught the light from the lamps and gave a solemn cold look to the village - and the snow squeaked and crackled underneath us.
"I love Mr. and Mrs. Curry. To me they are the fulfillment of everything I think marriage can be. They are beautiful lovable people and it seemed symbolic of them and their union to see them as I saw them tonight, one on either side of the bed, kneeling in their prayers. Dear simple, loving, kindly people. I wish I knew more like them."
On our last day we abandoned our sketch boxes, and with a parcel of turkey sandwiches and a handful of raisins in our pockets, walked "the Block", a long hike over snowy country roads that took us past the farms around back of the big hill that overlooks Haliburton. It was a bitter windy five miles that ended on top of the hill when we came to the cutting through the trees and slid straight down it on our seats into the village.
And so back to school in Toronto to start 1929. J.W.Beatty was the instructor in "Life", both drawing and painting. This meant working from the nude model. When I had first heard of this, up at Silver Island, from an art student who was staying at a cottage on another island, I was unable to

imagine that such a thing could be possible, that someone could stand up in front of other people with no clothes on and be looked at! Marjorie and I were so modest even with each other, that when we had "skinny dips" in those days we crept to the water under cover of darkness, wrapped in raincoats, and didn't look. But by the time I was in third year, ready for life classes, we had all become so used to seeing the drawings and paintings up on the wall that there was little sensation. Mr. Beatty was a chain smoker, with a wheeze that made talking sometimes difficult. His fingers were yellow-brown from nicotine, and shook so that you wondered if he could aim at the page when he sat beside you to give a criticism. But once on the paper, his hand was in control, and his line confident and true. He was a remarkable man who had been a fireman, and who had taught himself to draw from plaster casts in the fire station while the other boys were playing their eternal bridge or poker. Later he studied in Paris and became a competant academic painter, well respected in the community. But his heart was full of bitterness towards those artists who received more recognition than he, and he hated, it is not too strong a word, the men who were challenging the academic standards of the nineteenth century, and especially he hated the Group of Seven in Canada. Lismer was gone, but dear J.E.H. Macdonald of the curly red hair and voice that broke in a squeak was head of design, and both Franz Johnson and Lawren Harris were admired by the students. I

felt at the time that Beatty's spirit was so warped by hatred that he could never be great as an artist.
However, he ran the Port Hope Summer School, a resident hostel for art students, close to the old mill and dam in Port Hope. It was an experience something like camp, where the informal comradeship of your fellow artists, the men as well as the women, cemented bonds. Technically, Mr. Beatty had much to teach us, although I share the conviction that I heard more than one student express, that it took years to free yourself from Beatty colour. There was a characteristic look to the work of his students. He invented and popularized a light wooden sketch box in which the floor of the box was the palette and the lid a sketching panel held by the grooves in the sides. It held nine-by-twelve panels, which I found rather small, but Dad made me a similar box a bit larger, which I used for many years.
It was a great satisfaction to me that Dad took that kind of interest in my school work, and was prepared to come to the Friday night suppers with me on occasion and meet my friends there. Our "gang" included a couple of Chinese lads, and a French Canadian, big Ted Drover from Newfoundland, Oscar, with a strong Russian accent, as well as a few more familiar Ontario types. Mother looked on them with deep suspicion, but Dad met them graciously, and enjoyed the students as well as the guest speakers at the gatherings.

I was unwilling for that good third year to end, although the final dinner and announcement of results was a high occasion.
"But the real gladness came afterwards when we grabbed hands and went leaping along Dundas - laughing and shrieking, and there was the fun of finding a hurdy-gurdy man, and of dancing madly in a circle on the corner of McCaul, and of flinging restraint to the winds and just letting loose - a new experience for me. Skipping up University we stopped around the tulips and smelt them gustily... and of course the dearest bit of the whole evening was coming home with Ethel, and falling asleep beside her with scarcely a goodnight. 'Bells' were her last words, as Hart House struck three. Such a complete contrast to other years".
"Thank God for our year still to come and may there be others after it."
Marjorie and I managed an evening together before we separated for the summer. "The night came in a grey mist over a restless lake, and brought peace and a blessed sense of solitude to us. All winter I've waited for the summer to bring her to me, and now it comes alone. I have to face a summer of waiting for the autumn to come. Even June isn't to be ours. I don't understand. Can life go on forever this way?" And for the first time I tried to put words to the gnawing ache in my heart at Dad's whitening hair. "I've seen it so plainly. That's one

TUG OF WAR

While part of me was an art student, working hard, learning to see and to draw, part of me was a teen-ager exploring the meaning of life and what it meant to be a Christian. I went from my second Normandale camp to a student conference at Elgin House in Muskoka. This was the big yellow frame hotel that we used to see from the Sagamo when we took our annual boat trip up the lakes from Silver Island. It was memorable to us for Mother's comment, "That Elgin House, there's no smoking or playing cards, but they're full all the time". We chose to pretend that she meant that the guests lay around in a drunken stupor. Actually, she was remarking on its strongly Methodist character, perhaps the reason for it being made available for the annual conferences of the Student Christian Movement.
There I was plunged into a more adult version of camp, with students from all across Canada, and leaders from around the world. I felt very young, but I watched, and I listened. Back in Toronto I was invited to Sunday evening study groups with the same leaders. One of the men guiding us was the notorious Professor Hooke, target of some very critical complaints that had been aired around the University. He was accused of "poisoning the student mind", a phrase which inspired a popular song in celebration of his reputation. Of course I thought he was marvellous, and was flattered to be admitted to such

sophisticated company. We were studying Alfred North Whitehead's writings, of which I memorized a definition of God, hoping that by brooding over it long enough, I would understand what it meant.
"God is the actual but non-temporal entity by which the indeterminiteness of mere creativity is transmuted to a determinate freedom". Of more fruitful value was a phrase that stuck with me from one of the gospels, "Sirs, I would see Jesus". Increasingly, I did.
The Girls1 Work Board was using me as an artist, to make the little graphics that they needed for camp folders, leaders' magazines and so on. Both Marjorie and I were involved in youth conferences which were bringing together teen-age girls and boys The life of my own CGIT group at St. Aidan's was in full swing. And there were camp reunions, vesper services, shore breakfasts, conferences out-of-town at which I sometimes had to make speeches, or lead in singing or games. Letters flew back and forth from camp friend to camp friend, letters that were full of love, lighting up the day when they arrived.
"Sunday night - I am still in heaven. Reunion was miraculous. It 'renewed and created faith' - faith in the dearness of all of them - in the reality of camp loveliness - in the love of Lilian, in Miss Allison's uniqueness. Oh she was sweet tonight. Jessie told us quietly about her complete giving

of herself to people, and later I sat on the arm of her chair, with my arm around her neck and her head on my shoulder, loving her, and resolving in my heart to ask her help in my Big Muddle. A short talk with Jack Alfsen the other afternoon served to engulf me deeper in my Doubting Castle. I'm a little afraid of being convinced that art isn't the path to take - perhaps that might be worse than hope and misgivings alternately. But if I could find courage - the divine courage of Jesus!"
"Just had my usual row with Mother about CGIT. For a couple of weeks now it's been nag - nag - about me thinking too much of that and too little of my work. There's something in it, but I'm fed up to the ears with hearing about it. It takes all the bloom off ..."

"Sat. March 2. Poor Mum - She was told today that the doctors couldn't help her and now she's faced with the prospect of years of pain. I feel so helpless. I can do nothing. I don't know her - I'm no companion for her. It's too late to learn to help her....M came home today. I constantly rebel at

her being away, and I hated her little adventures with Miss Allison and Jessie and Avis Marshal - but mostly I hated myself for hating them. All day I have been tired out - worn right down - and discovering myself weeping in corners. I think that that's probably the bottom of the whole matter".

"Wednesday, March 27. I'm happy tonight with a queer incredulous thrill - Such a bombshell has been thrown into my static world. This afternoon walking through Queen's Park with Jessie -
"I wish you were two years older - Oh I guess I don't either - but if you were two years older I could leave you my job' .
"I laughed at her - of all the stupendous and absurd ideas. Poor Ontario if I were. 'Don't be funny, Jessie!'
"I'm not being funny. I mean it. I'd be quite willing to trust you with it'.
"And she asked me, as Miss Allison had half asked me before, if I would consider Girls' Work at all. Wish I could answer that question to myself. Which must I do - and can I do both? I'm being haunted by a nasty suspicion that compromise will never satisfy - and yet I cannot see clearly which is most vital to me. I can't imagine life without either. Jessie says of course I can't decide in the abstract - that I shouldn't try".

"Friday, Good Friday, March 29, Haven't written about St. Matthew's Passion yet and no wonder. There's no way to write about it. Quite the most powerfully moving music I've ever heard - and more tremendous of course because of the story it was portraying. Bach! I marvelled."
	My diary is full of the tensions between my three worlds, college, home and CGIT. Mother was not well, She was having a wretched menopause, labelled "nerves" by the doctors, enduring back aches, nausea and insomnia. I would listen for her voice in the morning, because its tone told me the kind of day it was going to be for everybody. All the fun had gone out of her. I had never been able to discuss ideas with her, and had long since stopped trying, but now there was no pleasing her on any level, and I was both helpless and guilty. Mother's religious convictions were summed up in "Honour thy father and thy mother". She resented my new loyalties.
In the spring of that year I was offered a job at one of the all-summer private camps. These were well established, well run, expensive, attracting girls from affluent families, and able to pay their leaders. But they were secular. "I've been weighing the pros and cons with M and Mother, and I'll see Jessie perhaps tomorrow and ask her what she thinks about it. I rebel at the amount I should have to give up, Beausoleil (a CGIT leadership camp), another camp, two weeks at Port Hope, July at

the cottage with Dad - and to balance all that there is $100 -experience - and some very hard work.
"More complications, and still more golden dreams. Jessie offered me the directorship of county camps (CGIT camps organized locally but directed provincially). My heart instantly says yes. Dad says if you would rather, by all means. Mother says a good deal more - with much emphasis and disgust. To her eyes I am throwing away a wonderful opportunity to make good contacts -fair money - and some experience - all for nothing. But my heart sings loudly."
After several days of dithering, torn between my own wishes and Mother's arguments, which had some merit, I offered to take the all-summer position if the salary were raised to $150. There followed two weeks of suspense, in which I wondered at my temerity at accepting a job teaching crafts, all of which I should have to first learn myself. But my bluff was not called. It was decided that the budget did not allow for such a high salary.
"Monday - Praise be! It's county camps - and I'm thrilled!"
This was the same spring that Doug sold his savings bond and bought a ring for Audrey, whom we hardly knew, but who was on the other end of the line when Doug was closetted upstairs with the telephone in Mother's bedroom, for an hour at a time. Doug's telephone conversations through the years had been a family joke,

monosyllabic, one or two grunts and an "0 K". We had realized that only love could have change him so much. He would be graduating as an engineer in a month, and in another year -marriage?
Someone else was in love that spring. Roy Wood was at Victoria College with Marjorie. He was one of the undergraduates who took her to the Proms and to concerts, and anywhere else he could persuade her to let him take her. She was friendly* but not interested.
"Poor Roy - He loves her - and she's filling his whole life without her caring at all about him. I can see his point of view so plainly that I'm sorry for him".
Ethel too, confided to me one day when we were lying on the grass in Grange Park looking at crocuses, that she had been engaged for three years and was to have been married by now.
"I'm not over it yet so I don't talk about it. You needn't fear for my health. It's my sanity. That's why I get so dreadfully blue sometimes". I looked at Curry with new concern, and new sympathy.
Two weeks later she told me that the man was in Toronto and going to the same parties as some of the college gang. They had been talking about his wonderful voice and about hearing him on the radio. "I just begin to get used to things when something new turns up".
"May 16, With Ethel to the con(servatory) at noon today, and plump into HIM, with a wonderful smile. No wonder poor Ethel

feels as she does. When we escaped, Ethel grabbed me and we walked, hard. "Gosh, damn, gollysl" And she told me about raking out her whole gallery of newspaper clippings of him last night, and of waking up this morning to find them all over the floor staring at her."
Curry was to live through a dozen more years at the mercy of her love for this same man. He turned up in her life, enjoyed her forgiveness, raised her hopes, dashed them again, not once but over and over. He had charm, good looks, talent and no conscience. I'm sure that he found Ethel's generosity flattering. I wish he could have known what her friends thought of him.
While love raged around me in one form or another, I remained unscathed, interested in an academic way, but waiting until I met the right man. Those at the College were friends, and I enjoyed playing and working with them, but there was nothing romantic between us.
"May 10, Tonight was our long-promised party at Mr. (Frans) Johnson's studio - such fun. That gang are the dearest people and we can laugh and be absurd with the happiest freedom. I can imagine the impression of an outsider - Archie in an armchair with Ethel - hair wild - in his arms, and a bottle in his hand - Frances a lumpy heap on the couch, hair still wilder -Ruth, scanty of clothes, cavorting - Wen and Les sprawled intimately on the floor, but the gladness of our fellowship is in

1930
The first county camp took me further north than I had ever been before, all the way up to New Liskeard. Considering that I was to be in charge of fifty girls and their ten leaders, it did seem a bit ridiculous that Mother worried about my making the train trip all by myself. I was all eagerness.
"July 17, 1929, After a very wonderful night - the old half-forgotten happiness of the motion of the train - bells clanging away into silence as we passed - the moon shining on my head - little lights that work for me when I want - a letter to Margaret (Stevenson, who had been at Port Hope School with me the week before) - and a curious inability to realize that this miraculous camping experience has really begun. I woke early this morning, shocked to see that daylight had brought the north, with tar-covered shacks, many telegraph poles and rocks and spruce."
I was met by a pleasant woman who was to be "Camp Mother", and stayed with her until the next day when we were all to be driven the twenty miles or so to the camp site. My hostess was hanging out a washing that afternoon, fighting the wind that was whipping the sheets up and over the line in a mad dance. It was a blue sparkling exuberant day. "Don't you love a wind like this?' I asked.
"No", she said. "It frightens me. It was a day just like this that the forest fire swept over Haileybury", and I

remembered the terrible disaster to that nearby town, that had driven people into the lake to escape the flames, and filled the air with dense smoke from which many could not escape.
The wind was still blowing two days later, when we were settled in to camp. It was so strong the first morning that the corn flakes blew right out of the bowls, and we ended up using mugs, with one hand across the top as a lid. The cook had never been away from her husband before, and wept quietly but steadily for three days.
My tent-mates were a treat. Mrs. Patterson, of the broad Scottish brogue, as she unwound herself from her bedding roll in the morning would exhort us, "Brothers, let us groan", and we would respond in unison.
We were not always in such agreement. When I found myself with a discipline problem, with three of the girls leading in noisy nonsense after lights out, it was she who thought the solution was to put a leader in each tent. But this was against my principles. The only discipline I wanted for the camp was self-discipline. I called a council hour, and the camp as a whole met the issue, and agreed that they needed rules, and that they would respect them. The campers asked, and got, from each of the three rebels a promise to cooperate. What is more, the promises were kept. What had threatened to be a disaster turned into a triumph. For several years afterwards, Katie Frew, the conspicuous ring-leader, used to write to me at Christmas. I can still see her mischievous eyes, and her fly-away black hair.

Before my next responsibility, which was a church summer school on Manitoulin Island, there was time for a day's pause at Temagami. This was dramatically beautiful country that I had glimpsed from the train going up. I spent a happy afternoon sketching near the edge of the lake. It was the next morning when I woke to find one eye swollen shut and my face so lop-sided that I could hardly speak, that I learned that the rather bothersome little midges that had been all around me while I was working, were black flies. Now I know! But it was not the flies that went into my diary.
"I did a sketch this afternoon from the general store at Timagami and feel terribly thrilled about it - but even more thrilled at the interest shown in it by a young chap, and his tentative approach for purchase. If I could only sell a sketch - my future would be made! I could feel justified in the expense this trip is being".
"Sunday morning, August 4. In the midst of another funny adventure and scared green. I'm to take the adult class at the Sunday School - on Daniel - boys and girls, and have neither convictions about Daniel nor courage to face the class. I'll probably be the youngest of them. It's a ghastly feeling. And add to that the prospect of speaking to the S.S. at the close of the lesson. Whew!
"Yesterday was an unexpected adventure. We had a very

rough passage to the island in a little gallant steamer, and it rocked and twisted and shook. Waves fifteen feet high, fifty feet between the crests. I revelled. Each mountainous bank of water would send the little ship almost on its side, and people turned pea-green around me. Such fun! But for all its fun I was lonely. Goodness how I wanted David (Marjorie) or Jessie or Ethel or someone to exult with me. Joy alone is only half joy...Why do my wonderful adventures of gladness and travel always come apart from David, and why does her life run away from mine? Specially when we're doing almost the same sort of things."
Between the Manitoulin Summer School and my next camp I had barely an hour in Toronto, just time to change trains. "A beautiful singing joy was being met by Mother and Dad and having a blessed hour with them before it was time to dash off again. I can never sufficiently be glad for the new appreciation of them that this year has brought. Dad is my friend now, my dear, understanding, understood friend. Today he said that this summer I had been trying my wings, and looked better than he had ever before seen me look....
"Dad's life has been given to us in some ways, and it is for us to give to the world some fruits of the fine steady honourable quiet life he has lived".
At the end of the summer Dad and Mother and I had a

fortnight at the "Cabin", the cottage Dad had bought near Beaumaris on Lake Muskoka. Audrey came with us, and gave me a chance to get to know my sister-in-law to be. And Marjorie managed to get there for a few days. We were both desperate for a reunion, and a chance to share the experiences we had been having separately. She was just back from two months at Camp Tanamakoon in Algonquin Park, and was full of its beauty, and the very different atmosphere she had found there. Most of the other leaders were students or graduates of the "Margaret Eaton School of Expression", the very organization that had tried in vain to teach us to be ballet dancers in our youth. It was a camp that stressed sports and physical perfection, and Marjorie's function there had been to add a spiritual dimension to the life. She helped the campers to build an outdoor chapel, and led them in worship.
October plunged me back into college. "Another year, the last. Ethel and I look at each other and smile a little, and wonder a little when we say 'last'. Incredible. Such a little while ago I was looking forward to four whole years, marvelling, and now I marvel more that they are gone. Will all of life be like this?"
Sometime during the autumn, Curry and I did a survey of our finished paintings and decided that between us we had the makings of a respectable exhibition. We eyed the walls of the

Royal Conservatory of Music, and took our courage in hand.
"Noon brought an interview with Dr. MacMillan (not yet Sir Ernest), most gracious of men, who made us feel instantly at ease, and chatted away about our sketches as if he had nothing on earth to do but entertain us."
We framed up and hung about twenty small oils in the lunch room and corridors of the conservatory. No sales, of course, but the satisfaction of seeing the work properly presented and feeling that it looked professional.
We were working and playing hard. My diary is full of parties in Ethel's room, of serious discussions about art and life, about the possibility of getting a job at the new technical school that was due to open in north Toronto in the next year. But in the meantime the family were looking forward to big doings at Christmas. Ken and Betty were coming home from Toledo with the new baby, and Doug and Audrey were to be married at our house on New Year's eve.
Christmas was like all family Christmases with new babies, exciting, hectic, and emotional. And the wedding preparations were even more so. Audrey was staying with us, although Mother and Audrey were temperamentally incompatible, and as Audrey became more tense and uncomfortable, Mother became more critical and irritated. I began to wonder if they could last until the wedding without an explosion. New Year's eve brought an ice storm that made Balsam Avenue hill impassible. The minister who

was to perform the ceremony was three quarters of an hour late in coming, and arrived eventually on foot, without his wife, Doug and Audrey were to go right up to Kapuskasing that night, so that Doug could resume his job on January the second. Doug's "best man" was to drive them to the station, but his car developed a flat tire a few blocks from home, the nearby taxi company just laughed at Doug's request for a car on a New Year's eve in that weather, and the poor bride and groom had to pile in on top of their friends in the chasing car, and be driven ingloriously to the station. Doug boasts that they had the last laugh, because their tickets let them through the barrier and into the pullman, where they were able to lock themselves away before the rest of us could buy platform tickets.
I fled to Haliburton the next day, joining Ethel and Ruth and Casey, who had been painting for a week already.
"January 7, 1930, This is really the period of New Year's reflections and resolves, for Jan. 1 was a whirl of busyness this year. But even now I feel not in the least retrospective. Gone, and it was a good year, that's all. Come, and it promises well.
"Lindsay accomplished its usual magic this morning. Once there, my regrets at leaving Haliburton the beloved, gave place to joy at the thoughts of greeting Toronto once more. Returning to school filled me with shivers of delight. Kathleen and I met, and kissed, and rejoiced in each other, and there were Archie and

Fran, and Leslie and Tong, and Ed leaping at me, and there were Ethel and Casey, just as natural as I had left them in the morning, and suddenly I found myself truly back at achool, perhaps for the last time in just this way. Both Dad and Mother like my sketches, which pleases me. They are better. I feel it myself".
"Monday, Feb.3 Life is moving around me very quickly. Two things happened today that seem to be hustling me out of the irresponsibility and freedom of my life so far, and into the workaday world of grown up. Mother made my appointment for me with Mr. Saunders, possibly my future principal, and A L (Arthur Lismer) offered me a Saturday morning teaching job. I don't want to be teaching so soon! I cling to my last happy independent year - but truly such is life".
"Tuesday The world moves, an 'interview' with A L tonight, also Helen Sanderson (neighbour, Malvern friend and fellow-student), apparently all is set to start this Saturday".
Arthur Lismer had been taken on by the Toronto Art Gallery as director of education, with a Carnegie grant to introduce a new concept in art for children. Lismer was inspired by the possibilities, and inspired everyone who worked with him. We made a modest start that first year, but by the next fall we had hundreds of children, picked by their public school teachers as the most talented and interested, and further screened by us at

the gallery. Curry was taken on the staff, along with three or four others, and Curry and I were the team responsible for all the eleven-year-olds, boys and girls. We had sixty of them between us. It is the perfect age. They have lost none of their openness and energy, and have not yet become self-critical or inhibited. Usually we would have a get-together with Lismer and the other teachers, perhaps over coffee, to plan a theme for next week, or contrive some new medium to excite the kids. After that we were on our own, organizing the materials, presenting the challenge, and ducking out of the way to avoid the stampede as our eleven-year-olds rushed to get started. They spread their work on the floor and knelt over it. We provided big brushes, big pots of colour, as much paper as they could use. We encouraged, praised, suggested further development, but made no attempt to impose our ideas on them. They were bursting with ideas of their own.
At the end of the morning we gathered an armful of imaginative drawings and paintings, collected the materials, and carried everything back to Grange house for storage, and to show to the others. There we would find Lismer, already off on a new tack, three jumps ahead of us.
All of the students in fourth year at the college were working under pressure, with exams looming and projects to be finished. But at the end of March, Marjorie and I achieved a weekend together. We went out to the "Falcon Inn" at West Hill,

Mother was critical of the idea, with dark reports of the goings-on there, drinking, business men and their secretaries in illicit liasons, and who knows what else. In the event, we were the only guests that weekend, and as the silence descended about eight-thirty when the kitchen closed up for the night, we were hard put to suppress our giggles. We walked, we read, we talked, and came back with our feathers smoothed into place, and a great thankfulness that we were going to be together at Tanamakoon for the whole summer coming.
The end of term came too soon. "Friday, May 9 An idyllic day, with sunlight that made the world look unreal and lovely and a mad gambol at recess among the dandelions, a beautiful noon hour prone in green grass, yellow golden flowers and flower-like children, a jolly dinner, and a gay feeling of nonsense. Casey, ungraciously enough, asked me to the dance, but at least I am going. Praise be. Ed and I concocted a toast list, and it has been a very dear last day. How I have loved life here. How to imagine that it is over"
"Monday... I'm keenly anticipating Wed. and the dance. The toast to the school is a bit on my mind - however!"
Our graduation dinner, for which Ed and I had helped plan the program of speeches, toasts, announcements of results, awards and so on, was held at the Arts And Letters Club. It was a

beautiful place, an old church, high ceilinged Gothic, in dark wood, hung with heraldic banners, romantic, and full of association with the great men of our world of art. The head table ran the length of the room, with its line-up of special guests and staff. The rest of us were at small tables in front of it. We were all dressed up and keyed up. One of the first features of the evening was the farewell speech by Robert Holmes a dear old boy who had taught us history of art, a painter notable for his very fine water colours of Canadian wild flowers
He opened his speech with an affectionate tribute to the school itself, and was just starting to talk about the students, when he hesitated, stopped, and suddenly fell behind the table.
"The dinner began so beautifully and before we had realized what had happened Death was there. We were helpless -we stood in horror-stricken groups without speaking, and heard the rattle in his throat, and saw his face grey and then opaque, and people doing things, Ed and Mac chafing his hands, Bernard fanning him, Mac listening for his heart. Mr. Beatty, who had been reviling Mr. Reid a minute before, trying to detect a cloud on a magnifying glass - Miss Coombs, here and there as she was needed, face set. Mr. Johnson, self-possessed, telling us how fitting it was, the unreality of it all, people with rouge over pale faces, eyes to the ground, smelling their yellow roses, Ethel's hand in mine, the terrible wait for a doctor, the damp, fresh night, the weight of horror clouding future memories, the

petty regrets about parties and graduation".
We drifted home to Ethel's room, and sat on the floor in front of her fire, needing each other for comfort. When the others had gone, Ethel and I went to bed, but we slept badly.
When I went into the college in the morning to clear my locker, there was a phone call for me. It was Mother. Dad had had a hemorrhage during the night and was in St. Michael's Hospital. Would I please come directly there?
"and then this morning Mother's phone call - and Mr. Holmes face leapt to my mind, and I fought tears and knew it was nerves and yet was sick with terror and dread. I tried to tell Ethel, but there were others there, so all I could do was hang on to her hard and cry on her shoulder. Ed was so great. He drove me down to the Hospital and Ethel came in and when I had seen Dad I felt quite released because he looked pale but normal, and talked to me and was just Dad.

CENTRAL TECHNICAL SCHOOL
Norah McCullough, who was Lismer's full time assistant at the art gallery, alerted me late in 1931, that her friend Edith Manning, who was a teacher in the art department of Central Technical School, was to be married at Christmas. In those days, for a woman teacher to get married was to get fired, so her job would be open. I had already tried to be taken on to the staff of the new Northern Vocational School, and been turned down as "too young". But Charles Goldhamer was at Central, and he had taught me at the College and had been very friendly and interested in my progress when our paths had crossed since. I telephoned him to ask how I should go about applying, and he set up an appointment for me with the Art Director, Peter Haworth.
Mr. Haworth didn't commit himself to anything at that first interview, but he did ask me if I thought I could teach a group of librarians how to make posters. When I assured him that I could, he told me to be at the school before nine o'clock on January 4, the first day after the Christmas holidays, prepared to do just that.
I was there, standing in the front hall waiting for him, trying not to look as awkward as I felt. He showed me where to sign the register to record my presence for pay purposes, and as

we were on our way over to the big flight of stairs up to the art department, he stopped me in front of an imposing looking man, ruddy of face, ruddy of hair, standing like a statue in the hall.
"You'd better meet the man who runs this place".
"Doctor Kirkland?", I asked, offering my hand. Peter kept his face straight with some difficulty, and explained to me later as we climbed the steps, that the heroic figure was Major Simpson-Ray, the chief caretaker, and not the principal, as I had assumed.
At that time, Peter Haworth was a young, good-looking, curly-headed autocrat, who was gradually transforming a mediocre art department in a secondary school into a dynamic powerhouse. He was given unusual freedom in choosing his staff, and instead of hiring teachers who had taken courses in art, he hired artists, and hoped that they could teach. He encouraged them to go on being artists, and fought a stand-up battle at the Board of Education on the issue. Some one down at College St. wanted to forbid him to practise as a stained glass designer while he was holding down a full-time teaching job. This was during the depression, and the stained glass trade was feeling the competition. But he won, not just for himself but for all the artists and craftsmen in the system.
Peter's method of teacher training was to fling you into the situation, and let you fight your own way to the surface. He

explained nothing, and his manner discouraged questions. When I reported to his office, as instructed, after my class with the librarians, he said to me only, "You can take PG1GH in EM3 this afternoon".
I found someone, I have forgotten whom, to translate. The first was a code for pre-vocational girls, first year, sections G and H. EM3 turned out to be the room up in the tower, How could I guess that? And so the days went. "Tuesday. In a state of headache, weariness, worry and hoarseness, I think I won't be a teacher after all. I don't honestly see any fun in trying to get twenty bored twelve-year-olds to draw a silly coal scuttle that they can't draw anyhow. Damn them. I wish I were home cursing the rolling hills of Haliburton for not rolling themselves into a good composition for me, and my headaches." For that first nightmare week, I lived from hand to mouth, with no timetable in advance, and no briefing on what I was expected to teach. "I feel that I should be recording first impressions but they are still too hectic to be very easily expressed. I'm dead sick of waiting around to see Mr. Haworth, and still lost when I wander away from the art department, and I wish heartily that I had a locker to call my own, and every hour I get dizzier and dizzier like Saturday mornings, in spite of which I begin to feel a little exhilaration at having a JOB and enjoy telling people. If only my head would stop aching, and my cold clear up I think I could recover my mental balance."

Once the first week was over, and I had not been fired, I began to realize that I had inherited Edith Manning's timetable as well as her job. My classes were not art students. In most cases they were "vocationals" or worse still, "prevocationals", youngsters unable to make it in the academic stream, who were given watered-down courses in English and mathematics, and allowed to concentrate on cooking and sewing, with PT and art to round out the week. They were toughies, and ready to walk all over an inexperienced teacher. These kids were the bottom of the totem pole, but I also was at the bottom of the totem pole, and grateful to have a place on it at all.
The other side of the coin was that nobody in the art department cared about them, and I was free to do anything with them that would keep them out of trouble. If, by dint of using all my native wit and my CGIT experience, I could find projects that they liked, and show them how to produce presentable work, we were even allowed a small stretch of wall to exhibit the results. This was when I discovered the magic of cut paper as a medium, easier than drawing, faster than painting, spectacular and fun. With sheets of coloured paper, chosen for colour harmony and tone contrast, they could hardly go wrong.
One afternoon when I was teaching, not in the art department up on the fourth floor, but down on B floor in a regular classroom, I was startled by a roar from a man standing in the open doorway. "Who is in charge of this class?" "I am," meekly.

he was a very gracious host besides being helpful about the mural. I feel quite as if I were going to decorate the library. It seems just a question of getting the ladder and starting in".
I used fairy tales as my motifs, and the space was generous enough to allow the figures to be life size, with the giant of Jack and the Beanstalk twice that. The paintings filled all four sides above the bookcases. The walls were coarse-textured plaster, agreeable to paint on, and I didn't mind the height and all the climbing up and down. The caretaker considered the weeks I put in on the job excessive, since he had seen a man paint a whole billboard in a single day.
He was my only negative critic. When the work was finished, the Library Board gave me a one-man show in the adult room, a party at the opening, and best of all, a surprise cheque for two hundred dollars.
Jimmie Dean, who was the young head of the Mathematics department, and courting an Oshawa teacher with whom I had become good friends when I directed the Oshawa CGIT camp, was into drama in a big way. That spring he put on Mr. Pim Passes By, with Nory and him playing the juvenile leads, and me having the lovely fat part of Olivia.

stoked by Dad every morning, and left alone until he came back after work. According to Mother, that was the only way to run the furnace! But Grandfather, who had nothing to do all day long except nurse the fire, knew that the most economical way was to add a bit of coal every hour, and keep it always burning steadily. I laugh about it now, but at the time it was not funny to Mother. She took it as a criticism of Dad, who, now that he was gone, could do no wrong.
Grandpa had a saving sense of humour, and a gentle irony which I enjoyed, but which neither of his other women shared. Grandmother's face would tighten, and she would look at him in reproof. "Archie!"
At school, I was beginning to enjoy the other young artists on the staff. Closest to me was Noreen Masters, tall, dark, vivid, a magnet for anything male, and a scandal to some of the older academic teachers. Nory had a sense of style, and designed her own clothes. The form-fitting silver satin gown that she appeared in at the Teachers' Federation dance caused a sensation. Irene Doole (who was a perfect lady) approached me in the staff room the next day. Had I been at the ball? Well, no, actually I hadn't. (I had, however, seen the dress and Nory in it). Irene intimated that she was speaking to me because she believed me to be a friend, and what Noreen needed was "a friend to tell her". I'm afraid I told her all right, gleefully.

Nory had been a student in the art deparment, of such outstanding brilliance that she had been invited back the year after her graduation to take over the classes in illustration. She had imagination, and could stimulate it in her students. Before the annual "Bazaar" she had her classes working on posters eight feet high. Her own walls were filled, and every other room in the department had three or four of these huge posters covering the back wall. The students worked where they could find wall space. Art staff drifted in and out of all the rooms, approving, criticising. We got used to the chaos, and found the excitement contagi ous.
Mr. Haworth asked me to make one of these posters to advertise the work of the Vocationals, a grim task for me, feeling as I did, that it would be in competition with the best work of the senior students. However, remembering what even the Pre-Vocationals had produced, I used cut paper, hid my insecurity, and got away with it.
The annual exhibition was a time of reckoning when you could see the quality of the year's work. The week after it, Mr. Haworth called me in to the office. "Did I want to go on teaching?" The truthful answer would have been "No", but even in that first difficult term, there had been moments of exhilaration, and I needed the job, so my answer was "Yes". If I were to go on, Peter explained, I should qualify by taking the

teacher training and getting a certificate. Then I could be taken on staff, and paid a salary.
Some points were stretched to convince the Ontario Training College for Technical Teachers that I had the equivalent of six years experience in the trade, and, since my academic qualifications were high, I was somewhat grudgingly granted permission to enter the school in Hamilton the following September.
I was painting hard, developing some of my Haliburton sketches into canvases. "February 29, Monday. This has been an interesting weekend. Thursday night the exhibit down at St. Aidan's opened, and people said so many nice things about my Snow Drift that a perfect fever of excitement and ambition and dreaming laid hold on me, and I was thrilled and yet embarrassed by every compliment. I think they are very bad for me but I have such an appetite for appreciation".
Wed. March 2. I telephoned today to ask about my canvases, (entered for the OSA spring show) and Mother had no news, and sounded very disappointed, so I went back up the stairs to the life room feeling very flat, and I sat on the edge of the table and went into a daze, while the bad little PGG's chattered. I wanted so much one of my things to be hung! I thought about the Preview, and the Moulton peole being there, and Jessie and M so expectant - And I wondered about the hopes of it coming tomorrow, and so on and so on, and I wanted to phone and ask about the afternoon mail and I decided that that would be too

eager, and so on and so on . Then Mother was out mailing a letter when I turned the corner of Pine and she had the news for me. I expect it is the Frozen Lake. Wish now I had sent the Drift too, except that I know perfectly well if I had sent the Drift, I should be regretting not having tried one of the others".
"Friday March 4. Tonight has really been rather wonderfully thrilling, my beloved black velvet making me feel beautiful (comparatively) and slim and well-groomed, with the wrap to add soft luxury and my darling's yellow roses to say she was loving me on my Big Night. It was fun being with Mother because I could run off when I felt like it and have my little side chat with Nancy Caudle and Gilbert Schlater and Murray and so forth. The "Moulton Line" was strung along in front of my picture, being very rapturous when I first found it. It was all a bit sweet and silly, absolutely different from last year."
This was the spring of my first car. Curry's brother, Ronald, was ready to sell his little Chev convertible, (blue, with a rumble seat at the back). I saw it when I was in Haliburton at Easter, painting with Ethel. When the roads were open again after the spring break-up, Ron drove it down to Toronto, picked me up at the Beach, and took me out to the Exhibition grounds for my first (and only) driving lesson. What a marvellous feeling! I was surprised, and disappointed, that he wouldn't let me keep the wheel for the drive home.

But Ev Caswell, Betty McCarthy's sister, had her license, and came with me after supper, uptown to Curry's place. I did more swearing at other drivers on Danforth Avenue that night than I had done in my whole life up to that time. I hate to think what they were probably saying to me.
"Today, April 29. An Epoch! a thrill! Wonderful! I've just come in after two and a half glorious wonderful hours in Gabriel. I'm so serenely at home behind the wheel after all these weeks and years of trembling imaginings and misgivings. Yesterday I was learning on Ronald's car. Today I was driving my own!"
My CGIT group were ecstatic about the car, which they christened "Gabriel", in compliment to the Archangel in Green Pastures, "Shall I blow Boss?". It gave us mobility, and made our weekend camps easier of access.
It also made possible the mural painting I had been given permission to do on the walls of the children's room at the Earlscourt Library. George Reid, formerly principal of the College of Art, had done a mural around the walls of the adult room. The Library Board was mural-minded about Earlscourt, and having approved my sketch, they agreed to pay for the paint that I would use. All that wonderful experience at no expense to me!
"Wed. March 23. Today I trekked out to Mr. Reid's for a very nice visit, and the delight of tea in his beautiful home, pewter things on the mantel, dusty rich coloured hangings over the balcony, lovely mellowed wooden chairs, a glorious room! And

he was a very gracious host besides being helpful about the mural. I feel quite as if I were going to decorate the library. It seems just a question of getting the ladder and starting in".
I used fairy tales as my motifs, and the space was generous enough to allow the figures to be life size, with the giant of Jack and the Beanstalk twice that. The paintings filled all four sides above the bookcases. The walls were coarse-textured plaster, agreeable to paint on, and I didn't mind the height and all the climbing up and down. The caretaker considered the weeks I put in on the job excessive, since he had seen a man paint a whole billboard in a single day.
He was my only negative critic. When the work was finished, the Library Board gave me a one-man show in the adult room, a party at the opening, and best of all, a surprise cheque for two hundred dollars.
Jimmie Dean, who was the young head of the Mathematics department, and courting an Oshawa teacher with whom I had become good friends when I directed the Oshawa CGIT camp, was into drama in a big way. That spring he put on Mr. Pim Passes By, with Nory and him playing the juvenile leads, and me having the lovely fat part of Olivia.

bananas. This is so outstandingly different from anything we have ever been able to do before that it's somewhat of an occasion. Last night was Mr. Pim - a mixture of delight and horror. George and I got beautifully twisted in our second act, in a quite original way, and went doggedly along picking up prompts gratefully. But at least everything went well, and nobody was any the wiser. Curry said afterwards that she was thrilled... and amazingly enough Mother liked it."
After that I was less apt to be mistaken for a student, and began to feel at home with the other teachers on the staff.

NORTH LAKE 1932
Ethel's father said we could use his hunting shack to live in for the summer if we wanted to. It was on a little lake about eighteen miles from Haliburton, very isolated, hard to get at, but Curry was keen, and I was thrilled at the thought of a whole summer to paint, with no other responsibilities. Ronald prophesied that we'd be frightened to death when we were left in there by ourselves, good for about two nights, but we refused to be put off. Mother almost had a fit, and was sure that we would be attacked by a bear, lost in the woods, dead of appendicitis, or raped and murdered, probably all four.
Curry's Uncle Andy and his wife, Jenny, came with us to help carry our gear and see us settled. Andy's car was a Model T Ford, with a high frame that could clear the rock outcroppings and deep ruts on the backwoods lumber road that led to the first lake. It was advanced in age, so when we came to a hill, we all piled out to lighten the load, and sometimes to push the car up. Once at the lake, Andy unloaded the outboard motor he had brought, and then hauled a skiff out of the underbrush where it lay hidden. It was a five mile trip along Pine Lake, five miles of woods and more woods, with only a lily-clogged bay or a bare rocky promontory as landmarks.
Andy had a woodsman's eyes. He could see the entrance to the portage where we saw unbroken forest. He safe-stored the

skiff and its motor, and we heaved the packs on our backs, and started up the trail. For a long mile and a half we trudged through the bush and over a height of land to North Lake.
"The portage was hard. The hills were persistent things up which we struggled doggedly, each step a fight against the weight of the pack on our shoulders pulling us back, and Andy would come to the resting spot, half a grin on his strong lean face, and let himself down with his blue eyes merry and a joke at one of us."
There was a rowboat hidden in the trees at the end of the portage. We crossed North Lake to the far side where the cabin was, on a little point of land, a low building in a thick stand of red pines, with some shelving rocks that made a natural dock.
It was a two-room hunting shack, a kitchen with a wood stove, a rough plank table and one bunk, the second room with bunkplaces down each side. We left Andy and Jenny the privacy of the kitchen, and chose for ourselves two bunks in the big room with windows looking out to the lake.
The next day I wrote: "Tin plates are laid out on the table, potatoes are boiling in the big pot and beans in the frying pan. Jenny is just about to plunge into the Outline of History (one item in our library for the summer) on the bunk behind. Andy has vanished into parts unknown, and outside is our lake! Thirty slim red pine trunks are outside the window and through the other I can see the spired spruce and birch of the

hill across the lake. It has been heavenly fun. Curry is cutting bread with the red bandana hanging from her dark blue jeans and her green hat on top. This morning Andy took us down the north shore, and in the reeds ahead we saw a moving red spot which became a deer, and we got close enough to watch her shaking the flies away, moving about feeding on the lily pads, then when we were close, she raised her head, looked long at us, and turned and in great graceful plunges, cleared the weeded spot, and turned for another look before she disappeared into the woods".
Andy and Jenny stayed with us for two days, taking us through the short portage to Beaver Lake, on into Otter Lake where the herons had their colony, beyond that again to Kelly's Pond and by another portage into beautiful East Lake. In every lake or pond Mr. Curry had stowed a canoe or rowboat to serve the hunting parties he guided for in the fall. He had given us a big world to live in that summer.
Curry told me then, that when she was a very small girl, her mother and father had moved from Irondale to Haliburton, travelling down river by raft. The family and all the household goods were piled on it, including the cow. Mr. Curry had worked before that as a cook in a lumber camp. He was a marvellous example of first-generation capitalism, from rags to Leading Citizen of Haliburton by imagination and hard work.

"July 7. Days have been so full! Just after I finished writing on Tuesday Mr. and Mrs. Curry arrived. I looked up when I heard a wild hoot and howl in the distance and asked Andy what it was, and both he and Ethel knew it was her father's call, so he jumped into the boat and came back with them. Ethel gave her mother a hand to help her out, and the first thing we knew she had toppled over and was knee deep in the lake, while Mr. Curry had sat right in and was practically drowned. Jenny and Andy and I were helpless with laughter. Then I had the fun of seeing Mrs. Curry running around in my blue shorts and giggling about it.
"As soon as they left we went across through Beaver Lake, Otter Lake, Kelly's Pond to East Lake, and there in a clearing we found the perfect log camp, fashioned from big pine and cedar logs, and facing a marvellously beautiful bit of shore. East Lake is wonderful.... the lake goes up sheer rock to heights of birch. We walked through the portage thrilled by the great cool green of the trees far up, the damp rich, reedy grass at our feet, the one huge pine twenty feet around, and the bird singing like a canary. It felt almost tropical, growth was so dense and so rich. In Otter Lake we found a heron's nest in the top of a beautiful pine, and three herons right at the tip. I loved the adventurous feeling of it, Andy ahead, his pack moving and his gun held loosely but in readiness, Ethel's light walk, hat perched perilously on the side, and her red handkerchief hanging."

"Andy has a delightful sense of mischief. We shellacked boards last night (to paint on), and he told us stories, of the wolf with the knot in his tail, and later of the war - buried three times at Vimy, marked permanently disabled, stealing grapes in the south of France - with a drunken khaki girl in London, leave in Edinburgh etc. Suddenly there was a bump, pad, pad, bump - bump - and Ethel's head shot up and her eyes opened -'What's that?' Andy's big ho ho ho. It was a potato he had tied to a string and rolled along the floor. Then came stories of scares in camps, with potatoes and phosphorescent hands, and strings and tin cans tied to 'Fritzies' barbed wire', to be pulled by the boys when they wanted to make a false alarm - and the mules that kicked, that they could send greenhorns to feed -ho ho ho."
"July 8. I had a good birthday. We ferried Andy and Jenny across early, and left them at the portage, exulting muchly that now we are alone in our own lake. Then round the shore we loafed, discovering big things, a loon's nest with one egg, a new warbler, a pitcher plant, a glorious rocky height, the creek's mouth, and home.
"Then as we were working away at the big table in the afternoon Ethel heard a bit of a splash, and up we jumped to see a whole f amily of ducks, marshalled by the mother. They sailed past, diving, aeroplaning, swimming, and she herded them out on to the little rock where they all shook and preened and shook and

fussed and finally settled down, nine lovely fluffy babies, facing the mother and in beautiful order. Late in the afternoon the rain came and we kneeled on my bed, elbows on the sill, and watched it.
"And my party was such fun with candles and muffins and coffee and a sense of high occasion."
For the first two days that we were on our own, we made sure that we had done all our chores before dark, including our last visit to the extraordinary privy. This consisted of two slim saplings nailed between trees to make a seat that was suspended over a natural crevice in the floor of the woods. Privy was the wrong word for it, but it was an airy, leafy retreat in fine weather. Before dark fell, we were safe indoors, with a lamp lit.
By our third day there, we were at home, far too comfortable with our woods, our shore, our sylvan perch out back, to be uneasy when night came. Our delight was to take the boat and creep in it along the shore at dusk, seeing how close we could get to the loons that shared the lake with us, and hoping our deer would be feeding again.
We painted and drew, and drew and painted. And learned! "There was a quiet blue in the hills all morning. We painted on big boards, and noon brought moving soft clouds. Light was incredible. The clouds were reflected exquisitely in the water

and the water strengthened from pale mauve to deepest cobalt. Even at our feet it was strongly blue. The clouds were those tantalizing beautiful torn things, all wisps and movement and light shadows. Then night brought a sky velvet dark and powdered with stars behind feathery beautiful pine needles. I did a good sketch of the camp while Curry drew me in the late afternoon and we went to bed before dark. Yesterday I found myself comfortably settled beside a very yellow and green serpent with a bright vermilion tongue. It gave me an uncomfortable morning."
"July 10. This morning, eating porridge by our lovely out-of-doors fire on our log stools, we tried to trace my (lost) hatchet, and discovered that instead of Saturday, it was Sunday, and we had skipped a day. Such a shock! Tomorrow we shall have been here a week - impossible as it seems. Already home seems very remote, and Tech just doesn't exist. It's been a stormy noon. Rain and wild wind came just after dinner and we abandoned the dishes to draw the lake."
"Yesterday was good. We woke up to bright sunshine and trekked over to Beaver Pond for a morning's work in the lily pads, then dinner, cooked dirtily but blissfully among the ants on a nice rocky point and wonderful clouds to tantalize us, till they alarmed us by thundering and sprinkling. Home we dashed, hysterical with laughter, and dragged our bedding indoors and then danced in the rain, and swam, and laughed and rejoiced in this perfect adventure."

"Thursday, July 21. Heavens how the days are flitting! I feel as if I'd skipped a whole day, for last night we were at East Lake, land of mystery and delight. Before dark we paddled all around it, and the big woods were black with depth and silent. Into one maple fastness a deer bounded, otherwise all was hush, and even the fantastic snags were things of strange quiet. We dared scarcely whisper, and when we left that awesome bay we swung towards the sunlight again and found ourselves indeed in Solemn Land, the hills three times their real size and still as mountains. I can't realize that a lake of such big mood is really a little lake. It has none of the intimacy of North Lake. At the far end is a tiny cabin, so surrounded by huge trees that I felt as it the woods were ready to snatch it up."
"We were funny sights en route. I staggered under the pack, with my glasses around my neck and my gun in my hands. Curry, far more picturesque, was burdened with the red blanket, rolled, then two rubber boots tied to that, then two canvasses hanging, and below that the sketch box, under her arm her huge portfolio, and then two paddles."
Looking back on that summer, I think its greatest gift was silence. Curry is a person of few words. She has never just chattered. In time, we came to read through meals, eating at the table outdoors, our books propped against the trees that supported the table. We had no radio. If a leaf fell, we heard it, and looked to see why. Every sound meant something.

Mail was an event, brought to us by the rare fishing party that passed through. For me, it was usually painful. Mother had little sympathy with my retreat into the wilderness. "I do understand how she feels but I wish she had some imagination. For all she loves, she can never understand, and, with Virgil, 'one grows tired of everything except understanding'. I think I'll just try to forget her in between mails. We've just chased a HUGE mouse down his hole. A porcupine is sawing up the barn, and far out on the glimmering moonlit lake a loon is crying".
"M writes from London this time, and says we must come (to England) together, and my heart says yes, we must! Surely if we will we can. But my mind says, next time it will be with her family and you know it. Tonight we went back to our point, and there in the dying light, painted. And small fluffy song-sparrows flitted around us and a gloriously clear white-throat sang goodnight in the dying light. And 'our duck' sped clucking and peeping across the lake as we rowed noisily home in water that was wonderfully and strangely patterned."
"Last night was a black night. The lake was heard, angrily, but not a thing could I see. I felt as if the blackness were a real thing slapping my face. It almost hurt my eyes. Tonight is a true star night. 'The sky has a thousand eyes', but we are tired and beds are too inviting to be ignored".

"Impossible to go to bed tonight without writing, although I'm so tired! ..We went to East Lake last night, and there spent an hour in excited curiosity and nervousness watching a MOOSE, and actually making sketches of the creature. We stayed until it was just too dark to see him, and trembling with delight, went home to our funny little island to make camp in the dark, and get ourselves a much-needed supper. Such a falling over, such a spilling, such a losing of knives and dropping of butter and choking on pine smoke, and crying of damns, and intense enjoyment, all in one meal. Then we paddled down the shore, and it was eerie. The flash would make the nearby snags startlingly bright and the shore .secretive and black. The big dead spruce hanging over the water was a magically beautiful feathery vision, as unreal as a dream and as isolated...tonight we saw the moose again and Curry took a whole roll of snaps of him. Sometimes we were within ten feet of him. Gollies!"
The duck-and-her-duckling that had been so shy when they first used to circle the lake, skittering quickly past our point, had become accustomed to us, and swam past without concern. The baby was a teen-ager in a panic the first time that his mother left him alone on the lake. He spent all day skimming up and down calling to her. We saw her in the sky, returning, and watched him aeroplane towards her crying, as she glided down beside him. The next day he was less upset, and after a few days he would fish happily by himself while she was away.

One day a flock of bluejays came by, and Curry said it was a sign that summer was almost over. The calendar was saying the same thing, but the end came too suddenly. " A bomb came today in Mother's handwriting, marked IMPORTANT, and suddenly my heaven's peace was shattered and I was left all shaken and needing very much the rocks and the quiet of the portage point, and the feel of the moss under my head, and a little weep. Mother wanted me to come home at once to see Dr. Kirkland and Mr. Haworth re. some impossible scheme of doing part-time commercial and part-time heaven knows what, Hamilton or teaching I gather."
"Today brought two youngsters as well as Andy and Jenny, and how I am bored. Gollies how I covet the quietness of our solitude. I am anti-gregarious, but the selfish solitude of this place was one of its most healing qualities. My darling wrote me today, after at last getting my letters, and her understanding has made me so happy. She, at least, appreciates my need of this beautiful blissful place."
"Night of the 25th. It has been such a queer day. The morning woke me early, silently, to memories of the specialness of the day (fourteenth anniversary of Marjorie-and-Doris), to thoughts of David in London, and her Valiant here, yesterday's painting, the beauty of Pine Lake, idle morning thoughts, interrupted by the Cadi-duck, and I watched him swimming along in his young lovely pride, looking lonely. He has been so sweet

lately. He stands up in the water and flaps his small wings, and then splashes about after little fish, and this morning he caught one just by the rock, and at that, I heard Andy go out, and I watched with fresh pride as he wasn't startled, and I was glad he trusted us so, and I wondered where his mother was, all before lying down again. A few minutes later I heard the 22 pop, and I decided that if the porky were being cornered I should be on deck, so out I hustled in my bathing suit, and Andy, to my horror, was shooting at our dear little duck, and even before I spoke he shot, and I saw the poor lovely little thing turn over, and then choking with tears and dismay I climbed over the rock to him, and he was a poor little dead thing in my hands".
The return from North Lake was like dropping from paradise into hell. Noise! Everyone talking at once! Confusion. Chaos. Doug and Audrey and the baby had come south on holiday from Kapuskasing, and Ken and Betty and Brian were in Toronto for the Exhibition, staying down the street at Caswells, and there were constant family gatherings, and trips to the CNE, and although I loved them all, I couldn't stand to be in the middle of it. Even the return to school was a relief.

	HAMILTON
The Ontario Training College for Technical Teachers, (quite a mouthful), was a typically government-style red brick building next door to the Hamilton Technical School. In it were gathered the would-be teachers of printing, sheet metal work, carpentry, motor mechanics and so on, about twenty men, and a half dozen young women who were, most of them, being trained to teach domestic science, a euphemism for cooking and dressmaking. Two of us were qualifying to teach art. We were a good group, getting along well together, doing our best to support the poor victim whose turn it was to teach us a practice lesson, and spending our spare time in riotous games of badminton in the big room upstairs.
John Byers and I, both graduates of the Ontario College of Art, were at the same boarding house a few blocks from the school, being thoroughly spoiled. Our landlady, Mrs. Jones, was not only a good cook, she had an eye, and every dish was as attractive to see as to taste. Three times a day we sat down to a small feast.
The lectures were elementary to anyone who had done much reading or thinking about education, and I had done both at leadership camps and for my own CGIT group. The real challenge for me, came in the practice teaching. Hortense Gordon was my critic-teacher. At the time I didn't realize that she was a

highly respected abstract artist, one of the pioneers of that movement in Canada. We liked each other, and she gave me her theories of design to teach, with the flattering comment that she would not usually trust anyone else to handle them.
Her analyses of the principles of design were far ahead of anything that I had been offered at the College of Art. There, although one man offered us a nodding acquaintance with Dynamic Symmetry, we had been taught little theory. Usually we were given a job to do, a lamp shade to design, a repeating pattern to make up, and praised or criticized on the details as we worked them out. We had far too little experience to arrive at our own generalizations. I was hungry for more intellectual content, and Mrs. Gordon provided it. She taught that the basic principal of rhythm was orderly sequential change: of direction, of size, of shape, of tone, colour and texture, and that any two elements in a design could be brought into harmony by creating a step between them. To me, this was light shining into darkness.
Her husband was the Director of the art department of the technical school where she taught and supervised my practice teaching. I believe that he was a heavy drinker. It is the kindest explanation of the rudeness with which he treated her in public. He would burst into the classroom without knocking and ridicule her or scold her about some trifle. Poor Mrs. Gordon maintained her customary little smile and made no protest, implying to the class and to me that John was just being facetious. But the pulse in her throat throbbed more noticeably.

Back in Toronto, change was not so orderly. When Doug and Audrey had returned to Kapuskasing after their holiday at home, they were greeted by a dismissal notice. The company was laying off staff, and Doug had been there only two years. They had allowed him to come south and buy major house-furnishings with no warning of what lay ahead. It was a blow. Mother rose to the occasion with characteristic generosity and invited them to move back home until Doug could find a new job.
Equally characteristic was Mother's inability to carry her generosity into her relations with them. She was critical and difficult, keeping Audrey on the defensive, and the mounting tensions between them naturally involved Doug. Mercifully, eight-months-old Dale was too young to be considered naughty whatever he did, but he was a lively restless baby, and inevitably disruptive.
I would arrive home from Hamilton on Friday night, too late for the family meal. Mother would keep my dinner in the oven, and bring it to me to the dining room table, where she would season it with her tale of the woes of the week. I remember held-over white fish, held-over white potatoes and cauliflower or creamed onions, with an obligato of Grandmother's unreasonableness, Grandfather's stubbornness, Dale's being spoilt by Audrey who spent all her time fussing over him instead of helping with the house, and Doug's futile approach to job-hunting by sending off applications instead of chasing around and seeing

people. Poor Mother. She had no way of imagining what it was like for them, and no generous tolerance of their differences of temperament. I was her safety valve, and she blew off steam to me all through my miserable meal.
The pay-off came at Christmas, when Doug's gift to his young wife was black lace lingerie. Mother exploded! I thought it was rather touching that the poor lad had not had all the romance knocked out of him yet, but Mother was furious. Driving back to Hamilton after the winter holiday was pure pleasure.
The office secretary at the Training School had offered me a blind date for the dance that closed the fall term, and so I met Walt. We are still friends and occasional dancing partners sixty-five years later. He was eight years older that I and serious about finding himself a wife, and although I wanted marriage too, I was in no hurry. Mother had been told by a plausible fortune-teller that I was to marry a university professor when I was twenty-six, which gave me still four years to play around. But I liked Walt, and enjoyed his attentions, even while I doubted that he was for me the ultimate answer.
Marjorie was teaching at the Ontario Ladies' College at Whitby, and we saw each other on weekends, and talked long hours about love, and what it meant, and what it did not mean. During that year she began to realize that she really did care for Roy, who had been pursuing her faithfully for three years.

weekend. Thursday night the exhibit down at St. Aidan's opened, and people said so many nice things about my Snow Drift that a perfect fever of excitement and ambition and dreaming laid hold on me and I was thrilled and yet embarrassed by every compliment. I think they are very bad for me, but I have such an appetite for appreciation. M and I dined yesterday lovingly, if such an adverb isn't ridiculous, and it was, as it always is, completely natural and easy to be with her again. Later, in her room, she talked about Roy to me, and as she sat at her table, hand nervously scribbling on some paper, her eyes on the wall in front, she was a woman, no little girl left at all, and I felt as if I were watching her step truly into grown-up land. It was all a bit like ' our future "us"es' and it pressed home the truth of our growth. We are women now. I'm so glad Roy has come as he did. Funny how I used to dread the time a man would 'come between us', and funny how little like that it has seemed. Perhaps if or when M has become 'sure' it may be more so, but I doubt it".
Much of my year in Hamilton was spent in an emotional confusion, trying to sort out my own feelings about Walt, agonizing if a week went by without a telephone call, in highest heaven when he was in attendance, doubting him, doubting myself, dreading Mother's critical appraisal, trying to see him with Marjorie's eyes, being very young and inexperienced, and very much obsessed with sex. Walt was the first person to stimulate that. My diary makes painful reading.

The spring brought other things to think of. "Feb 24. Doug has a JOB! Thank heaven, thank heaven ! And Mother unfortunately threw cold water on to their first enthusiasm of telling her, which was bad psychology. Mother makes so many mistakes in handling people that I am cheered to the point of believing that, after all, I won't ever be just like her. I think I must have a share of Daddy."
"Wed. March 1. Big Thrill - When I came in at noon Mrs. Jones told me that Mother had phoned and all three of my canvases have been hung. Ye gods! What was wrong with the hanging committee? The fly in my ointment will be that everyone will think the H.C. crazy and the show a mess - which proves, on reflection, that it is for public approval I crave, not anything more exalted. Gollies but it's swell news! What a nice weekend to look forward to. Hope Curry had at least one taken. I'd feel pretty sick if she didn't."
This was the first year that I entertained myself by drawing house plans. It was a way of making my day-dreams concrete. "It's to be one of the lovely old square stone houses, and I'm going to rebuild it inside if necessary till it's just right for us. Walter will have a little den on one side of the front door, with the telephone. The other will be a big livingroom with a lovely open fire place. The diningroom will be small but very sunny and my kitchen will be utterly compact."

keeping secrets from David - and tonight I confessed to the precarious position of my heart. It was good to curl up in the big chair in the den, my head against my darling's breast, held tightly by her arm and kissed, gently again and again to say that she was loving me. Her love is such a steady strong rock in my life. I know it so utterly, that I look with a little fear on liking that hasn't such a good foundation of long and early friendship. Even if Walter should like me, love me a little, it can't be love for my sake. He doesn't know my weaknesses, my fears and joys and passions and fancies, and I don't know his -and I don't care for him, love him, the way I do my dearest. It's the man-woman factor that changes it all".
When term was over in Hamilton, and I was safely "certified", there was a precious week before I was due back at Central Tech, time for my promised trip to Moncton to meet Dad's family.
"The porter is making up the berth, and I feel a childish delight in the precision with which he pulls down the upper and snaps things into place. Then he slaps up the rings and hangs the curtains. It's exciting to watch....I love the ceremonials of travelling at night, dust bags for my hat, shoes for shining, the smooth round head of the negro porter, the slow grin of one to the other, crisp cool white sheets spread by casual but expert black hands....I woke, as I thought, just before dawn, and looked with wonder into a world of water with a lighted city rising high on the other side. Quebec? I think so. It gave me a strange

feeling to see it in such an unfamiliar guise. Then a little later I woke again to find snow outside, drifted up around little Quebec houses like so many A.Y.Jackson canvases....Still later I began to look some more, and the loveliest of all the sights for me was the broad blue-green St. Lawrence, broken by floating ice, brooding in colour under the grey sky, with a ghost hill on the other side, faintly lighter than the water in its snowy patches, faintly darker where the woods made patterns on it. And in the foreground, rotting drifts, or bits of villages, whitewashed square houses, or blue and faded red and green. Lovely sights! My heart ached to be painting them....Some of the places I passed in the dark last night, were in great rhythms of mud and snow, thrilling things, with more of the Quebec houses accenting them....I'm so glad of the snow. This is the best winter I've had this year....A nice man has just told me that the glorious line of hills that I've been trying to capture in very soft pencil is the Gaspe coast, and that the lake in front of it is the Restigouche River. How I wish Dad were here so I could talk to him about it all. This is his country. How he must have loved it....We've been passing villages with intriguing little houses that are gone before I can get them down, but at least I'm accumulating a lot of useful scribbles".

beautiful eyes and a much more sensitive face. But Mother is the loveliest surprise of all. She was beautiful, smooth of contour, and smooth of skin, and looking blooming somehow, as if she were healthy and happy. I felt envy of Daddy for his lovely young wife, and his adorable family. How we were sweet! And then I feel sick at heart when I remember Mother's resentment when I was born. I suppose I was to blame for much of the friction between Mother and Dad. Wonder how much there was. Mother has forgotten its very existence." But Mother had told me many times of Dad's delay in getting to the hospital after my birth. She waited all day for him, and was probably too angry to speak when he came in "after work". She also told me that I was born with a lot of dark hair, which the nurse did up in little braids all over my head, and tied with candy ribbon bows. Mother declared that she suspected me of being an Indian baby, switched in the crib.
"How sweet is Aunt Fon. Like Mother, I find myself loving her best, the dear patience of her, and her loving way of remembering us all as children, even her dependence and gentleness, without the spice of Aunt Ad, and without the intelligent grasp that Aunt Molly has kept. But she is lovable.... She is more like a picture than a person, bent and passive in her chair, her black gown of twenty years ago surely, with jet beads, and silk bands down the front, the foot stool her father had made for them to use as children in church, her pride in the old home".

Marjorie met me on my return home with the news that now she was "sure", and still between us nothing was changed. It was then we began to plan a summer that would give Roy and me a chance to get to know each other.
I had regretfully parted with "Gabriel", and bought myself a full-sized Chev, strong enough to pull the little trailer I fell for. This was a punt, complete with oars, that could be packed full of gear, and pulled behind the car on its own carriage. Roy would sleep in the car, and Curry and Marjorie and I would share the little square tent that could be rolled up and put into the trailer for travelling.
It was certainly an educational summer. Roy was an experienced camper, good at fires, at packing, at all the man's jobs that Curry and I were used to doing for ourselves. What we learned was to contain our impatience at the time it took Roy to do those things. His pace was deliberate, and both of us were quick workers. We bit our tongues (usually), and got out the sketch books to make use of the minutes. What we all learned was not to leave Marjorie alone with practical problems. The morning that Curry and I were off painting, and Roy had taken the car into town for servicing, we left Marjorie, reasonably enough, to get lunch - menu agreed, no worries. But Marjorie had grown up with an older sister, and a Mother who liked cooking, in a doctor's household that always included a maid, and was an innocent in a kitchen, and even worse at a camp fire. We found her opening our big five-pound tin of jam, not by prying off the

lid, but by cutting it around with a can-opener!
For Curry and me it was a great opportunity to work from diferent material than the woods and water of North Lake. We drove east to Ottawa and turned north there up into the Gatineau hills. Quebec villages were organized differently than our familiar Haliburton, and the architecture of the houses interested us both. On the way down from Mont Laurier, which was our most northerly point, we saw a frame house of such charm, that I stopped the car, backed up for a better look, and then ventured through the gate and up to the door to express our interest and pleasure. We were graciously received. Our French was equal to the occasion, and we were given a tour of the interior of "Ensoleilee". It was the memory of their old church window, set in the end wall of the livingroom, that dominated my house plans from then on, and inspired the vertical picture window which is the most important feature of the home that I eventually built for myself.
Roy let his beard grow that summer, in a time when beards were rare. Curry and I walked ten paces behind Marjorie and Roy as we promenaded on Dufferin Terrace above the river in Quebec, for the fun of seeing the on-comers collapse in mirth as soon as they had passed Roy's beard.
Our happiest week was in camp at Petite Riviere, a tiny village squeezed between a mountain and the north shore of the St. Lawrence River well below Quebec. The down-hill approach to the village was so horrendous, two miles in low gear, that there

were few visitors, and we were the centre of attention and hospitality. A group of young people took us to themselves, including us in the sing-songs that were their favourite form of party. They were all members of the church choir, used to singing the mass, and their voices were lovely together. Two of the young men took me back up the mountain through the woods on a partridge hunt. For that one week we became part of the village.
Mrs. Beer was not willing to let Marjorie travel overnight with Roy on the train, unchaperoned, so we drove them back to Montreal to catch a day train home. Then Curry and I, having stashed the little boat trailer in my cousin's yard, took off along the south shore towards the Gaspe peninsula. The car was winged after dropping its load. We tented where we could find a little stream and a good view, often on private property, but always with the owner's permission. We would knock at the house and ask to have our water pot filled, and if we liked the person who came to the door, we would then ask to be allowed to camp there. Curry was great at spying out fresh vegetables in the garden, and inspiring small boys to go catch brook trout for our breakfast. I remember one day when the heavens had opened and the rain was coming down in torrents, and from the driver's seat I watched little Curry, in rubber boots and her voluminous yellow slicker, her rain hat dripping all around, holding up her fire-blackened pot and asking, "Avez-vous un peu de l"eau?"
This was during the depression and before the baby bonus, and the people of the Gaspe were very poor. There was no paint

for the shabby little houses. But the fishing boats, mostly little dories, had to be painted for their very survival, and the odd bits of colour left over were used on doors or window-frames. Sea-silvered wood, with little touches of faded blue and pink and green, in a setting of breath-taking grandeur! No wonder we fell in love with it.

1934
Among other things accomplished by the summer was the recovery from my storm of romance, I had other problems. "Sept. 23, I've had a week of increased turmoil. At first I blamed my indifference to school on not enough holiday - then I thought I was tired, and now I'm in such a mood of disgust with teaching as a life for me that I am praying for courage to get out before it has got me and sapped all the creative energy I have and left me dry like the rest of the teachers here. Kathie and I talked about it on Friday, helpless to fight it and furious with the grip of it. If I can keep this restless discontent, perhaps I really will get out sometime. If, after teaching three years or two, I could have enough capital to get to New York and get work if I can find it, and to study if I can't - and then if I can get work I'll stay out of teaching altogether. At the moment I feel as if I'm selling my soul for two thousand a year and some holidays. I could live on less, on heaps less if I had to, and I'll never feel sure of myself till I have earned my bread by work and not by teaching.
"I've been re-reading my spring weekends with Walter, marvelling that now I am utterly without desire. I don't want to be kissed at all. I am bored at the thought of physical intimacy, and all I want to do is work, and have men to play around with. All the virtue claimed by psychologists for sublimation seems to have been accomplished by the summer.

Marrying Walter seems an amusing idea."
At Thanksgiving Curry and I had a return to North Lake. "My dear woods again - I lagged behind to taste again the silence, away from the rustling of our walk through the leaves, and the golden light in the woods was sheer beauty. That night we lay on the hard bench, and listened to the men talking, W.R.(Ethel's father), Ab Curry and Bill Walsh, swapping horse stories till they had discussed every horse that had ever lived in Haliburton, and bed, with Curry's head pressed close to mine, so that the mice that scrambled up and down my arm couldn't have a runway between us."
"We had a little hunt just as we came out to Otter Lake and got partridge which we plucked on the spot, poor little fellows. Otter Lake was beyond imagination beautiful. In each direction the colour seemed more amazing, more singing, more brilliant - a blazing aura of yellow and crimson and scarlet emphasized by the deep rich spruce - and the day was grey so that each colour spoke for itself alone, and the tones were true".
"Jan. 9, 1934 My poor Curry is in Hamilton (at the Training College). I had a card today, and I must write her to assure her that this week will end. The first one was eternal last year.
"All week I've been feeling like an ARTIST. Peter and Charlie liked my sketches, assured me that I'd learn more at 'my stage' from working by myself from a model than by studying at a summer school, and Charles (oh heavenly joy) said, "I've always

thought 'that some day you would be one of our more important painters' ".
In January Walt told me that he was engaged to be married, and I was able to rejoice for him sincerely, and to observe with interest that as soon as Walter was no longer courting me, Mother thought he was a "lovely boy".
The art department at Central Tech was on the fourth floor, strung along a corridor which crossed the centre of the building, above the auditorium. This corridor was several steps higher than the rest of the fourth floor, isolated, given a precious sense of privacy. At last, I rated a room of my own, and was spared having classes up in the life room, or down on the ground floor. One sink, in an alcove, served the whole corridor, and since almost all of our work involved paint, and therefore water, that sink was like the village well in Biblical times. Students and teachers met there, and waited in turn to reach an arm through the crowd to the tap. Gossip thrived. I am sure this was one of the reasons for the comfortable, informal atmosphere of the department. Peter, who could be authoritarian when he chose, was a clown, unable to resist an audience. Dawson Kennedy, fresh from a degree at the Royal College of Art in London, was gifted with tongues, and could mimic any of the accents he had met in England, and did. We had a lot of fun, some of it at the expense of those of the academic teachers who were baffled by our nonsense. I remember affectionately the sweet woman who taught French, and who never did get the point of

the story, "What happens to a girl who wears cotton stockings?" to which the answer was "Nothing".
Feb. 27, I went in to tell Nory something, and Peter came in, and sat on the table with us, looking very nice in his Harris tweed - I wiped off the table for him with pink kleenex. He started in to tell us all about the war, learning to fly, going up in his first balloon flight, his terror, and throwing out the sand and pulling in the valve. It was so easy and casual and companionable, and we could just see him strutting about London in his (very) new breeks....He is a naughty man. He met Jean Blundell (of the academic staff) in the hall at noon and when she said, 'Your wife looked beautiful last night', he looked surprised and said, 'Well, that's funny. She's not usually considered good-looking at all. I'm thought to be the handsome one of the family' "
"March, 1934, After my fourth OSA opening as an exhibitor and my first OSA dinner party, with Peter and Mrs. H., Kath and Dawson, Charles, Nory, Ed (Noffke, of OCA), and M. It was really a very nice party, dinner by candlelight, gentlemen all dressed, ladies ditto, prevocational place cards, a thoroughly good dinner. I wished we could have sat around in our very lovely livingroom all evening. Somehow I felt Peter's approval and I warmed to it."
The formal openings of the exhibitions of the major Canadian art societies were the dressiest and most crowded events in the Art Gallery's year. There would be two thousand people

thronging into the building. The societies vied with each other to attract the biggest VIPs to make the opening speeches. Viceregal luminaries came and were entertained beforehand at formal dinners. In the exhibition of each society, the President's painting, a major work, was given pride of place on the south wall of the long room, where it could be seen from the main entrance. Artists who were represented in the show were allowed in the day before on "varnishing day", so called from the nineteenth century practice of "touching up" a recently finished painting. It was a chance to see where your work was hung, and digest the significance of a place in the octagonal gallery (for the avant guard), or stuck in a corner (where it wouldn't show too much), or off in the square gallery with the water colours and left-overs. Early arrival on opening night was rewarded with a seat in the sculpture court, a chance to watch in comfort the procession of the great ones arriving from Grange House and taking their places on the platform. We wore our most formal gowns, enjoying the drama of the floor-length sweeping skirts, the bared backs and modestly suggested bosoms. I realized what was in the little Prevocational's mind when she wrote on an exam paper in the health department, that the function of the skin was to "cover the bones and make you more formal".
Easter saw me back in Haliburton, with Curry and Kathleen-soon-to-be Kennedy. The trip up was rough. "The last forty miles before Lindsay we slid about on the road in a terrifying

way. The first time the car swayed way across the road and then back, we all had weak trembling knees, and a hollow feeling in the middle. But by the time we had gone careening for the ditch, and been saved from disaster by a lane with a bridge in just the right spot, and again slid madly up to a telegraph pole and stopped just in time, we began to be amused, and finally we all got a bit hilarious....The thrill of the day was crossing the lakes. Bliss to be on the level. Bliss to see the lake stretched on all sides, white and hill-bordered. Bliss to step on the gas with a fair chance of keeping on the straight and narrow. Yesterday Kathleen tried her first oils. They were foul and so was mine. Today we left K on Curry's top verandah with water colours, and Curry and I strolled down the village, enjoying the mildness, and thrilled by the paintability of the water-covered lake, the mill, the rotting snow around the lumber yard, and the tracks as seen from the top of a very comfortable box car".
"Church tonight was terrible. My lips are sore from biting them to keep from laughing, but this morning in the little Anglican church it was lovely - Easter morning, lilies, a nice man, and the dear, ever-so-satisfying words of our service. I was grateful anew for it".
Thursday, April 5 or so. Such days! I'm drunk -hilarious and sleepy and blissful - days of hot sunshine, blackbirds calling and flying about in the swamp, me lying on my back beside the road, or in a little shack near the mill, or on

rotting ice at the edge of a river, anywhere at all! and letting the sun burn my face and warm my body all the way from my head to my toes, with a mitt on my eyes to shield it from the glare and bits of crumbly ice melting on the edges of it. Then to be walking on the rutted roads, eyes half-closed against the brilliance of the snow, each rut a gushing stream of water, the snow honey-combed and easily crushed, the sound of birds to make me stop and look into the branches, the rare sight of a black figure coming across the shining lake. Oh spring! a quickening of the pulses and a throwing back of the head and a wish to sing, to shout, to make hallelujahs echo across the hillsides - body's vigour - a recapturing of delight that I thought had died. Out of a dozen or so sketches eight or so good ones, not a bad record for a few days".
"Kathie has been great fun. Meals are jollier than ever before. She has a kind of radiant good-humour and wit that is making us all very gay".
By the time we were due to drive home the breakup had come, and roads were too dangerous for me to try. Ron and his cousin decided to "see the girls safely to pavement". We left in the dark to take advantage of the over-night freeze. "I was wedged into the middle of the back seat, so I closed my eyes and let the car jolting be a rock-a-by instead of trying to drive from back there. In the first couple of miles we waded some pretty deep lakes, but from there on, the roads were marvellously clear. The first half hour saw us in our only ditch, a deep

snowy hole that needed horses to pull us out. Then I redoubled my 'thank the Lord for Ronald' anthem, and we watched them chop, and shovel, and dig, and finally hitch horses and draw it out. Kathie got woozier and woozier and finally moved to the front seat, where there was a barrage of nonsense to lighten the trip".
Once home, I completed the move into my new studio, the big cellar room that I had been allowed to take over, to line with wall board, and to glorify by painting the concrete floor turquoise, and the brick fireplace a greyed pink. The windows were small and high, but I was used to painting at night, and so grateful for the space and privacy that I had no complaints.
Marjorie's wedding was set for June, as soon as term was over, and Eleanor and I were to be bridesmaids. M shocked her mother by insisting on being married on a Monday morning, an impossible time for caterers and florists. But it gave Marge and Roy the afternoon to drive north to our Cabin in Muskoka, for their first few days of honeymoon and rest, before taking off on their planned camping trip to the west coast.
The service is memorable to me especially for the moment when they exchanged the vows, not, as usual, by repeating them phrase by phrase after the minister, but without prompting, clearly, in one unbroken pledge. I was unprepared for that and the tears sprang. Another poignant moment was after the formalities of signing the register, when Marjorie's father held out his hand for the completed marriage certificate, and the

minister said, "Not any longer, Dr. Beer. It's somebody else's business to look after her now".
While the bride and groom were driving west with their tent, Curry and Nory and I were off to explore the Maritimes with ours. We had heard so much about Peggy's Cove that we made it our objective. But the area around Peggy's is impossible tenting country. There isn't a bush on the landscape! We drove as far south as Lunenburg looking for something as good to paint and as hospitable for tenting as the coast of the Gaspe, but we looked in vain. We turned around, and headed back to the country we had discovered last year. It was even better than our memory of it.
We pitched the little tent on a ledge of rough red rock ten feet above the beach that shelved down past the tide wrack to the salt Atlantic. Away off to the right we could see Perce Rock jutting out beyond the high rugged cliffs of the headland. Behind us, sloping gently up to the road, our big field was a garden of daisies and slender blue iris. A tactful grove of spruce near the tent gave us the essential privacy. The family who owned the field included Maurice, a young man who took one look at Nory, and became our host, friend, escort, encyclopedia and personal lobster-poacher. With his help, we located the owner of the empty house a few hundred yards down the road, and succeeded in renting it for five dollars for the season. It took another five dollars to secure a workable wood stove for its kitchen, but that was all we needed. We used the house as studio

and kitchen, and slept in the tent, in heaven.
Between our field and Perce, miles across the water, was a deep bay, closed by a sand bar five miles long, behind which lay the tidal flats, the estuary of the Barachois River, enclosed by a backdrop of mountainous hills, blue, blue-black, milky grey, depending on the weather and the light. We did most of our painting at Barachois, the fishing village just inside the sand bar.
The river flowed down through the mountains, spreading wide in the shallows behind the bar, but cutting a channel to the ocean at our end of the beach. The one daily train ambled along the sand bar, and climbed over a bridge across this channel, which was high enough to let the two-masted fishing boats pass under into the harbour. Perching on the edge of this railway bridge gave a perfect view of the little boats tethered in the channel or tied to the "stages" along the shore, with a grouping of fish shacks on one side, and on the other, a meandering pattern of mud flats at low tide, with the hills and the clouds to complete the composition.
When supper was over, and we were strolling up the road to the post office, with Maurice, or one or two of the other young swain, we would hear the slow putt-putt-putt of the one-stroke engines, and see the fishing boats putting out to sea for a night of "drifting" for herring. Sometimes it was already dark, and we would see only the lanterns on the sides of the boats and hear the putt-putt. All night they drifted for bait. In the morning,

far out at sea, the nets were pulled in, and each herring was hooked on the end of a line which was lowered into the depths where the cod lurked. When the cod had been hauled up and all the bait was gone, the fishermen headed for home, this time under sail. From early afternoon until five or six o'clock, the little ships, leaning before the strong afternoon breeze, sails sparkling in the sunlight, came dancing in on the white-capped blue waves. As they drew close to the bridge, down would tumble the sails, and the little two-masters would be brought smoothly to their moorings at the stages, for unloading.
There were tables on the stages, for gutting the cod, and a big barrel into which the livers were thrown. The gutted fish were carried in hods to the sheds for salting or, later, for freezing or packing in ice. Heads and the innards were tossed into the water among the screaming gulls. The men worked in teams of two or three, wearing black oilcloth aprons, and a big mitten on the hand that held the fish. Their movements were economical, repetitive, rhythmic. They talked and joked among themselves in gentle voices, and teased each other about the drawings and paintings we made of them. And kind! We met such courtesy, such willingness to find a box for one of us to sit on, such admiration, especially when we were immortalizing one of their own boats.
The social life was almost too active. Tall, dark and handsome Earl, who worked at the store, had reacted normally to Nory, and was around a great deal. Astonishingly, he gradually

transferred his attentions to me, and made my days and evenings sing. The Anglican minister was a young man who had decided to get the young people playing together but behaving themselves. There were lively square dances in the little church hall, with plenty of noise and music, but a minimum of rowdiness and drink. Earl swung me round and round until I reeled, and could see nothing but the glint of his black eyes. Cliff, who also worked at the store, was quieter, but also glad of three new women in the picture. "Cliff's swings were smooth steady delight, his head turning easily and rhythmically - ahead and then back, and ahead and then back, while everything but Cliff's head became a whirling line and I heard only the monotonous scuff scuff scuff scuff of feet in time to Mansell Leggo's fiddle". One day in the shop, Cliff taught me how to sweep a floor without raising a dust, and I still think of him every time I coax a broom along in little short steps.
In the barrel that held the cod livers, they decomposed, separating into oil, which rose to the top, and the nameless horror that was the residue, sealed in by the oil. When the barrel threatened to overflow, the level was lowered by opening the bung hole at the bottom to let the liquid gush out. I have no words to describe the smell. As one, we dropped brush and ran as far and as fast as we could.
Driving back from the Gaspe, Nory and I began to dream up a plan to take a year off and go somewhere together to study. That's when we planted the seed that grew and flowered in 1935.

LONDON
Grandmother had died while we were still exploring the Maritimes, actually on my birthday. By the time Mother's letter reached me the funeral was over, and her death would have remained very distant and unreal to me except for Grandpa's letter. Grandmother had been increasingly difficult during her last year. Hardening of the arteries was the answer Dr.Beer gave to explain her irrational spells. Sometimes she disappeared from the house and went up to Mrs. Trowell with stories of the cruelties practised on her by Mother and Grandpa. They were devastated by her inventions. I imagined that her death would be a relief to Grandpa. How young and wrong I was!
"My Dearest Doris, Thank you dear for your kind and sympathetic letter of the 22. I have been so prostrated with grief that I have been hardly able to concentrate my mind on anything much less write to anyone since I came home from Levis where I received a most cordial and sympathetic welcome and tender and loving care from my dear sister, now the last of my own blood. Even now when I call up in my mind that dreadful and tragic hour between six and seven on Friday the 7th when I held my dear little woman in my arms trying to soften her cruel pains, I feel the same helpless despair and horror as I did then waiting alone for the doctor to come with morphia so as to ease her agony. She soon got relief from it but never again uttered a

word or gave any sign of consciousness.
"It is quite true dear that few can realize the close and strong love that is engendered by a lifetime of close intimacy even if one's natures are not tuned to perfect harmony. Of recent years she was unhappy due principally to disappointed dreams of a different life and a growing change of mutuality due to high blood pressure and old age, which is inevitable with undernourished old people. Your uncle and I fully understood this and I for one never resented anything she said or did to me, knowing fully that she was not responsible. For Doris dear I loved her dearly with a love that was the very root of my life and I shall miss her every hour of the day and dream of her at night. She died at 3.30 on Saturday morning, and every night since, I awake from sleep at that hour....excuse this rambling letter. I am not myself at all. God bless you dear, Your affectionate Grandfather.
I remembered the tales he used to tell me of his early manhood i n Quebec. The first domestic telephone in the city linked Grandfather's office to his home. He was employed in a pharmacy on Mountain Hill when Princess Louise came in to the shop on her state visit to Canada, the visit that was marked by the turning on of the first electric light in Canada, on Dufferin Terrace. When Grandmother was pregnant with Mother, he took her tobogganing on the slope of the ice cone that formed every year below Montmorency Falls, but she fell off the toboggan, and accused him of trying to kill her and her unborn child.

remembered that as very funny, knowing that Grandma didn't believe her own story. Grandpa and I had a firm understanding and affection for each other, and a mutual sense of humour.
That fall my CGIT group, in celebration of our six years of growing together, had a great weekend up at the Cabin in Muskoka. It held all the pleasures of the place, swimming and canoeing, hikes through the woods, good food and good talk. But for me, the triumph of the camp was what happened on our way home. We had once again hired a truck to take us there and back. Its body was an open box behind the driver's cab, and we were cushioned on bed-rolls, laughing at the bumps and swaying on the rough roads. Part way up a steep hill, a few miles from the cottage, the truck engine laboured and stopped, and we began to slide back down the hill, gaining momentum as we went. We saw the deep ditch coming, and knew that the truck was slipping into it. Nobody spoke. Nobody screamed. The truck sagged on to its side as it came to a stop, throwing us into a heap. And only then did we break the silence. "Are you OK? Anyone hurt?" Nobody was. Except the driver.
Poor man. He had lived through the nightmare of having his brakes fail, feeling the truck start its downward run, and either choosing the ditch or being unable to prevent our plunge into it. He was beside himself, walking up and down the road wringing his hands, sobbing. I had never before seen a man so hysterical. All of us turned our attention to him, and worked together to help him back to calm and a constructive plan of

action. I still glow with pride in those kids for their maturity and control.
At last I had more art classes on my timetable, even one third-year group. "I am enjoying Peter again, and this summer has somehow made a difference in my secret poise. Nothing can give me self-confidence and assurance like a little love affair.
"Best of all, he likes my sketches, I feel quite genuinely, and I'm less ashamed to show them to him, as his are his first oils. We work in entirely different spirits, and the thing that made me feel so bucked is that he said I worked like Alec Jackson, in moods and transient effects rather than thinking as he does, of great constructive designs, co-ordinated and built up. He liked my two of the whole fleet at Barachois, which also pleased me".
"Sept.8, Wednesday night I went out to Brampton. It was both very happy and a little sad. Funny to be saying goodnight to Marjorie and leaving her, while she shared with Roy the little usual routine of going to bed that we had done together so often. Funny to realize that at last, the closest things were things that were none of my business, and that even as I didn't tell her the important things about Earl and me, so she would never tell me the important things because they wouldn't be just hers to tell. Perhaps telling isn't so very important". Something I didn't write into my diary was my reaction at being met by Marjorie in an apron. I hooted with laughter. From then on, I hardly ever saw her out of it. M. took to domesticity late but

with a whole heart.
"Dec.19, A week ago tonight day dreams turned to plans, and last week was a turmoil of bliss, misgivings, and so on, because Nory and I were pulled indifferent directions, she to New York and me to London, because Mother was so skeptical and unsympathetic, and because we COULD go! Peter had said yes and I was engulfed by waves of appreciation and enthusiasm. He was sweet about it. While we stood twisting our hats and nudging each other to say something he grinned as if he knew what was up, and tried to sell us life insurance.
"Thursday night, we felt, demanded some recognition of the event, even though I was celebrating London and Nory, New York, but we went in gala attire to the Royal York and loved it. The music was perfect. Oz and George looked grand and danced divinely. Nory was stunning in her brand new grey satin, and I felt all glowing and lovely in my precious velvet."
A week later, Nory had the inspiration for a compromise, four months in New York, to England at Christmas for study in London for six months and then a tour of England in a three-wheeler. We redoubled our discipline of saving every cent we could scrape together. And I painted bouquets of flowers and found a ready market for them among Mother's friends.
That spring Mother found Grace, a pretty blonde teenager, who needed a job and could actually keep house to Mother's standards. She and Grandfather took to each other at once, which freed Mother wonderfully. I was grateful for someone to laugh

and sing about the house after the grim years just past. I could go away with an easier mind.
The summer gave me my first experience of painting the rocks and islands of Georgian Bay. After directing CGIT camps in July, I joined Marjorie and Roy as staff at a lodge on an island in Baie Fine in the La Cloche mountains. Roy was in charge of "programme", keeping the guests stimulated and amused. I took anyone sketching who was interested, and was free to paint myself. Marjorie's job was to M with the Gs, as we nick-named it. "Mingling with the Guests" meant being herself, interested in everybody, merry or sympathetic or comfortably companionable as needed. Mother came with a friend for a successful holiday, with plenty of attention from all of us, and excellent fishing! One little point half a mile down the bay from the camp is still known locally as "Jennie's Rock".
September saw Nory and me off to New York. After a day and a night on the bus, we were landed in the big city in the silent dawn. We found a little cafe open where the white enamel tables were less remarkable than the voices of the other early customers. They really did talk like that! Pure Brooklynese.
Three days later, having visited the art schools on our list and seen the work done by their students, we were in the dumps. We were getting better work out of our students at Central Tech! What was the point of trying to pull ourselves up by those bootstraps? We decided to head for England.

In bunk - Nory above me, bless her. My little light on -gardenias and roses, gladiolas and peonies in riolous confusion, and a warm little pain in the heart because people have been so very very kind. We left for the boat in a feverish rush, barely taking time to pin our gardenias in place, and getting unpacked was rather hectic in such a wee stateroom in steaming heat, but from the moment the boat moved away from the dock it was sheer joy. The skyline was just as thrilling as the pictures of it, and the day was one of quiet greys that made it majestic instead of garish. Even Liberty was glorified by lovely tones. The breeze was life-giving. All day I had despaired of ever being cool again.... Then the bath steward turned up all warm smiles and beams, and assurance that "we two little girls" could have our baths any time we jolly well liked. And in no time he was back with three boxes for me, yellow roses from "the group", gorgeous flowers from Mother and candies too, and he followed us on deck with a corsage for Nory (also from my CGIT kids) - and then I did find the grey distance blurring a bit 'cause it was so extra sweet of them. They are darlings".
It was the beginning of one of those separate and perfect times that life surprises you with. Being put at the Captain's table for meals made us feel approved, and gave us the companionship of the most charming man on board, Major Arthur Balbernie, a writer, travelled, very British but in love with New York, and delighted to have Nory and me in love with him. Then there was Scotty, the young man who had gone to the States seven

years ago and made good, but wanted his little daughter to grow up a Scottish lass, and was on his way home to prepare the way for his wife and the bairn to follow. Add to that mix, "Winnipeg", good-looking, callow, and smitten by Nory from the first glimpse, and Elinor, a very pleasant girl of about our age from Rhode Island. The six of us played deck tennis, danced in the bar at night, sat long hours talking in two or threes, watching the "phosphorescent green froth along the hull and the wide swash behind", rode out two days of wild wind and heaving sea, and another day of violent emotional stress because Nory had been flirting with a sailor who was trying to set up a date with her.
"Winnipeg went into a dudgeon first of all and then, with his heart in his mouth he told Nory for the good of her soul about how indiscreet it would be to keep the date - what a hell of a swell girl she was, and he was afraid she might do something to cheapen herself in the eyes of the crew or the passengers. Then he had a perfect spasm of nerves, and walked round and round with me just wringing his hands mentally, while Nory and the Major went round and round in front of us and he told her the story of his life."
We were shocked back to a sense of proportion by the news that Mussolini had bombed a town in Abyssinia, that Italian troops were mobilizing and that it was virtually a declaration of war. The Major was in the reserve army, subject to immediate call-up. He took it for granted that he would be in it.

Winnipeg was excited and talked about "doing his bit for the old sod" until I could hardly bear it. It was like living through a replay of novels I had read about the early days of the first world war. Had we learned nothing?
"When the Major came and sat down I asked him, 'How are you feeling tonight?' and his 'bloody!' was the perfect answer. We were. Why - why - why?"
The seriousness of the situation flung us into an intimacy that was very different from the playing we had been enjoying. "His fourth campaign, and he says that life has already been so glorious and he has known such happiness and also such unhappiness that the war comes as an escape, a way out without any 'housemaid stuff', and to hear a grand person like him saying that makes it all more unbearable than ever. Thank God for him to talk to, only why must he say that he's glad his last week has been such fun, and that leaving out today, we must make the memories fit to last four years. Damn him. Why must he say things like that? But it's true. We must. If only we could make these days worth keeping."
"Friday Oct.4, Reports this morning confirmed last night's rumour, 1700 or 1800 killed, men, women and children, Italy advancing. Baldwin's address expected hourly".
"There was a queer minute or two in the lounge after dinner, when I came in and found a group of perhaps ten people in front of the radio, all standing, all watching and listening with all attention, cigarettes forgotten, and only the man's voice,

English and cold, telling us that the League (of Nations) was meeting in committee at that moment to consider steps in Abyssinia....
"This morning gave me another of those perfect hours that seem to come on shipboard with double intensity and frequency. Suddenly the dread left me and I felt great wells of love for England, sympathy with her greatness, and reverence for her poetry. I was sick with need of words to say it. Rupert Brooke helped in the scrappy bits I could remember. Finally it needed the glorious old hymn tunes and the majesty of their words to let it out. Dear land that I shall love, I'm glad to be British today".
The trip handed us a bonus. We were due to dock in London at dawn, but during the evening a fog closed in, and we woke to thick mist and the discovery that we had not even started our journey up the Thames. Reprieve!
"After lunch we suddenly were very thrilled to see the Major's training ship, the Worchester, and saluted it with ceremony, and then went madly off to learn 'Here come the British with a Bang - Bang' and sang it again and again , with gestures.... Ships, ships, ships, freighters, barges, sailing smacks with red sails - the P and 0, with stories of Shanghai in it, and all of us together, blessedly together, and able to be very gay, gay to the last, when we went up to say goodbye to the captain, and after kissing each of us heartily and talking to the men, he came down for an extra hand around, and shot the ground

from under us. Twenty-two transport ships left England today, each carrying probably two thousand men, and the Major took it and said quietly, 'That means that the balloon has gone up', and we knew that he would be going too".
By the time we were disembarked, and the luggage assembled it was a dark rainy night. "I might have been all right, except that suddenly Elinor Christie and Scottie said goodbye, and shook me too much to give me a chance to recover and then I had to say very quickly nothing and get in to the taxi and just pray that it would start, and as it was the tears were pouring before it went. Dreadful to see him standing there still smiling, and the smile harder to bear than anything else would have been".
It was still raining in the morning when we set off from our comic little "private hotel" in Bayswater. Comic and in quotation marks because it was so incredibly out of an Edwardian novel, probably by E.M.Forster.
"Tues, Oct.8, Still in Craven Hill Road but with a difference. It was a funny day. We woke from bad dreams with the grief only a little stilled, and ate a silent and rather exhausted breakfast, and went out to find London streaming with rain and we squilshed across Kensington Gardens thrilled to be there, even although still heavy-hearted, and finally found Exhibition Rd. and the College. One of the little things that said London to me was the sign for Litter, in beautiful Roman lettering, illuminated. We had a long tiresome wait at the school, and very little satisfaction at the end of it. 'Come back

again tomorrow at 11.00am, with examples of our work' ".
We decided at that point to look for lodgings. One of my favourite Dickens stories was the Tale of Two Cities and I had dreamed of living, like the Manettes, in a "quiet square in Soho." After a shocked exploration of Soho, a stone's throw from Piccadilly Circus with its constant crowds, in the heart of the noisiest concentration of shoddy little sex shops and cheap cafes, that dream dissipated, and we remembered the Major's advice and turned towards Chelsea.
"This afternoon was distinctly better. We had fun walking down the funny little streets and seeing always lovely little squares of green. The first place we saw was absolutely beautiful, colourful, comfortable, perfect - the look of character and personality that made it seem like home immediately - but just a bit more that we should stretch"
It was over a chemist's shop on Kings Road, a fine big front room, with a fireplace (gas to be sure), day beds, good walnut furniture, drapes and accessories chosen with taste, even sterling silver flatware! After we had looked further, and seen the rooms in our price range, we agreed the it would be cheaper in the long run to love home, and spend time there happily, than to need refuge from it. On the same floor, also vacant, was a smaller room, with a single day bed, but with complete kitchen equipment, just right for George when he arrived next week.
George was one of Nory's students, who had ventured into her private life, calling diffidently at the house, escorting her

where he might, developing into a "follower". So far that was all he was, but he was a nice lad, close to her in age, and she was rather glad that he was to be with us in England.
"Coming wearily home, we decided to find a bus, and in the process of dashing to the curb to catch one, I fell flat in the wet street, cracking down on my elbow. By the time Nory reached me from the centre of the road things were beginning to go black - and I barely had time to thrust my bag and map at her and say 'Hold this' ".
Poor Nory! There I was, flat on my back in the gutter, among the wet yellow leaves, the water running around me, eyes wide open and out cold. She thought I was dead, and was already cabling home in her mind.
"It seemed funny to be wet in bed, and there was no time or place - it was all rather comfortable and damp and far away, and then suddenly there were Nory and a 'bobby' and a strange man, all looking exceedingly worried and I knew what had happened, and felt all shaken and weak amd ashamed"
Thanks to the bobby, a roving LCC ambulance pulled up and took charge. We were driven home to the hotel, and I was helped upstairs, feebly protesting, to the accompaniment of a lecture from the ambulance attendant on the folly of "burning the candle at both ends".
So we were in our little room, surrounded by wet clothes, underwear and all spread out to dry, Doris in bed and Nory hovering, when the Major was announced. From the depths we were

CENTRAL SCHOOL
"Bless him, bless him, bless him. He's still real Nothing has happened yet! He's been to the war office and apparently they have promised him the job he wants, but he's not being sent yet and he'll be here again Friday. He was tearing to the station to catch a train. I'm only afraid he may not have (caught it), and we watched him off from the door, his black hat jammed on, his raincoat swinging, and us feeling almost like real people because of having seen him and touched him again".
"Sept 9,1935. Today was rather a weary one. We were late getting up and went directly to the Royal College after breakfast, to be advised that the Central School of Arts and Crafts was really the best place for our purpose. Coming back through Kensington Gardens was a great thrill. It was thick with prams. Children like leaves, just as colourful and beautiful and restless, and their nursemaids looking like English nursemaids should. We said that it took a childhood of romping in parks to produce people like the Major. There were nice Englishmen in trench coats in the park too, with big dogs. Coming through the gardens the trees were high, leafy and branching, dull in colour and the grass was a singing green. It was a dull, damp day, just wet enough to suggest that rain might be on the way".
We were given a cordial welcome at the Central School, charmed by the principal, who allowed us to choose a good range of classes. Until next week, when they would be starting, we were free to move in to Jubilee Place, get settled and explore

London.
"This afternoon I left Nory to her unpacking and went off in search of a hairdresser that was open. Down to the bridge, across it, with a thrill when I saw the river, tide going out, little grey and white boats stranded on the sloping, muddy, rivulet-riddled banks, and the river swift and streaky in the centre. Down past Battersea Park, which was a great beautiful garden, and down and down past funny rows of square stone-fronted houses till, via a bus, I reached a department store down there that did have a hairdresser. Here, they dry your hair for you too, which is hard on the wave but very pleasant".
"Sept. 11, Such a beautiful evening, so sweet and good and comfortable and friendly and lovely-to-look-at! We dashed home from school and I did some feverish shopping while Nory got things ready for salad. I had just time to do my hair and wash when the Major came. We made tea for him, and told him of our wanderings and were thrilled that he had worried about us, and glad that he liked our room, proud that he approved of our address, and every once in a while went into a perfect ecstasy of joy that he was here!
"Nory has just asked me to 'do the Major up brown' so that when we read about it, it all sounds as superlative as it feels now, and suddenly the thought that it will be 'a year ago today' hits like a blow, and I feel frightened of this dear loved year ending.
"Somehow the room seems christened since he has seen and

liked it. I'm feeling terribly bucked too that the war seems less imminent. He had a row with the war office this week when a pompous individual in mufti said he was 'on the reserve', meaning under orders.
" 'You interest me strangely', said the Major, smiling with a glitter in the eye, and leaning forward. 'Do go on'. I can just see him doing it".
After the Major left, we had Scotty for supper. "Nory was reading some of her poems to Scotty and me, and their loveliness went to my soul with a new shock of surprise. It's the first time I've heard her read them, and to hear her here in our dear room, with lamplight, and the bronzy mums, and all stretched out comfortable in the wee chair with my feet towards the grate, and good old Scotty on our sofa - bliss - sheer bliss it was...We rehashed the trip, heard about his string-pullings for a new job, about Anne (his wife) and the little girl, all together waxed eloquent about England and its subtle, inescapable richness and beauty, even discussed the Royal Family a la all true Britishers, and he praised my tea, the lamb, and Nory and I washed up in a regular orgy of joy and gratitude and affection for him and the Major".
"Our first day at school seemed very short. We drew hard all morning and all afternoon, with indifferent results, except for a very healthy backache. It seems funny to be in that art school world without really feeling of it. At Meg's at lunch-time I listened to the chatter in correct English around us and

envied them the accent that is theirs by pure accident rather than their own efforts... It was fun to lean out of the window during the model's rest and find ourselves looking down on the jumbled chimney pots and curving narrow streets of London".
"Saturday, Much of today was made up of pinching myself or squeezing Nory's arm to be sure that it's real. It's been a day of rare deep joy, that has been made up of nothing but the gladness of being here, and appreciation of its beauty and loveliness. I left Nory ironing this morning and went to Canada House by myself. The first lions I met looked like Trafalgar Square, so off I hopped, and thanks to the map, I realized that suddenly here I was at Westminster Abbey. I didn't go in, keeping it for a ceremonial first view, but I walked on winged feet up Whitehall. It was part of the magic of the day that I should pass just as the guard was being changed. I stood on tiptoe peeping through the fence over the top of the shoulders and thrilled by the flashing silver helmets, white-plumed, the scarlet tunics, resplendent with braid, and the swords, and more than all, with the black lambskin fur saddle robes and the restless horses.
"Seeing Canada House touched me suddenly with unexpected poignancy. And I pored over the register, to be rewarded by Mary Deeves, Esther MacWaters and her mother, Mrs. R.Y.Eaton, Mr and Mrs. Lismer and Marjorie, Ruth Home, and so on and so on. On the way home I spent Harry's lucky coin for a second-hand copy of The Little White Bird - and this afternoon was spent in Kensington

Gardens, sketching the lovely children in their excitement beside the Round Pond, watching the afternoon die in a quiet grey haze that came gently down over the pond and the great spreading trees near it. It was perfect to be reading Barrie there, like something long dreamed of, and suddenly true... I'm hoping hard that George will arrive either before or after Monday's date with the Major. It would be too desolate if I had to go alone. The dear Major. Miss Busbridge asked Nory all about him this morning incidental to cleaning the room".
Miss Busbridge, soon affectionately shortened to "The Buzz", was a sharp-nosed and sharp-voiced landlady, who soon taught us to leave the beds, the cleaning and the breakfast dishes to her. Nobody else could meet her standard. For a week, we came home to find that she had also re-arranged our groceries and dishes. After we had given up trying to maintain our own kind of order, she said to us, "I wondered how long it would take you to adapt yourselves to my better way of doing things". We stopped struggling, and got along with her famously from then on.
"Sunday, Sept.12, We walked miles this morning, all around beside Rotten Row, jeering at the ones who couldn't ride and marvelling at the grace of carriage of those who could, and me thinking, as I have so often thought, that horsemanship is one of our birthrights, and must be claimed early or it is lost. How I should love to be able to ride, love to, but doubt if I ever shall. We leaned against the fence in one corner of the park and watched six guards in busbies go through quite a lather in the

process of changing posts with six others, and then strolled on down through Kensington in a sort of light-hearted careless idle enjoyment that lasted all day. Down at the other end of the park we walked beside the lower end of the Serpentine (River), again entranced by the beautiful coloured ducks, the tailored grey sleek pigeons, and then by a flock of gulls or terns, with the British 'dark circles under the eyes', Buckingham Palace was just right. They even put on a minor show for us there, four hearties marching up and down outside the gates and the sentry boxes, and putting the poor bored sentries through something that resembled the shorter catechism... All afternoon we wandered through Westminster and along either side of the embankment, impressed by the massive buildings near Millbank, with their fine simple sculptured pieces, liking the amusing fish wrapped around the lamp-posts, and in love with being there. Actually seeing Big Ben and the dome of St.Pauls and the Houses of Parliament. God is too good! (although he had a relapse tonight when my second pair of good gloves vanished into thin air and are NOT to be found)".
"Monday, Oct.14, Another day of drawing - with a gnawing ache in the back of the neck, and an amusing sense that the criticisms sound familiar. Haven't I heard those words before? or even used them - not once but scores of times? It was a funny day in spots. Nory has been worried about George, and I was grumpy about my gloves, and I hurried us on to the wrong bus this morning, and the day passed with less than our usual

"Tonight the Major took us to the embankment and for a memorable bit we looked up and down the river, all dark blue and mysterious, with the accent on mist, a dark line of little boats tied end to end, near us, and up and down the river soft depths of blue, with little lights. It was very quiet and peaceful, like this whole beautiful tranquil city. Funny that even the buses, for all their bulk and haste don't even scratch the surface of the inner quiet."
"Oct. 15, Our first lesson in book illustration today, with Nory hearing with secret amusement her own teaching points flung back to her in even her own words. I liked Mr.(John) Farleigh, enjoyed his presentation of the problem, but we wrastled over ideas and all we got for our pains was (a) hysterics, (b) one Bayer aspirin advertisement. First letter from M tonight, forwarded from Canada House, just a newsy bit of gossip really. She sounds busy and happy".
"Wed. Oct 16. Zoo all morning, with a fierce pain in the middle but with JOY at the end of it. Mr. Skeaping, our instructor, gave us a lesson at the end of the morning that left both of us thrilled to the ears with the possibilities of it. His point of view is an new one to me and a most stimulating one. This afternoon I slugged hard on a Roman alphabet in pencil, and the teacher said that I had done a lot of work in a short time. Even such slight praise just about laid me low. I felt marvellous, all coy and gratified and pink. And there was a

telegram from George to say that he was here, but whereabouts here we had no idea, and then Scotty blew in, up on top of the world because he'd just landed a swell job. He was so pleased, and I was so pleased that he had come right to us to tell us about it, and he leaned back in the chair and just beamed and talked about "home tomorrow". We had just had tea, and I had spilled the coffee over Nory and my bed and the floor, when George arrived in a great swither, and Scottie left before the tumult and the shouting had died. It was good to see George and Nory so pleased with each other... We're a nice family and the second room will be sheer joy to have".
"Yesterday Mr. Skeaping explained that outline was a vain hope, and solid form the only logical approach to drawing, and we bowed our heads and said 'aye'. Today the attractive-looking young woman in green advised me to spend more time on construction and to ignore shading. 'Let your line suggest the form'. No wonder the poor kids at CTS used to tear their hair".
"Friday, Oct 18, Very Late. I was very tired tonight after school, but dinner was a specially gala affair, clean tablecloth, candlelight and sherry - and we were all gay. I had to dive rapidly into the crabmeat salad because I could feel the 'hoo-hoo's coming on. And for an hour or so we worked hard and happily till the room began to get cold. Then, huddled over the fire in George's room, we started on budgets, and discovered to our dismay that we were spending far more than we ought. It was a solemn evening from then on, with Nory cutting George down to 2

shillings per week for cigarettes and George not liking it much".
"Monday, Oct 21, Mother's wedding anniversary, poor darling. I hope she get a letter from me today to give her something else to think of. George tucked us in last night with special affection and kissed us both goodnight, which was sweet for me, because it seemed like his gesture of approval, perhaps in reply to my telling Nory that I think he's thoroughly swell and good to live with, which I do, increasingly. Today was life drawing all day, with a marvellous model, a golden-brown boy, who had a beautiful body, well-muscled and yet young and full of form, and reminding both Nory and me of Florida (Nory's sailor on the American Farmer), memorable also for a criticism from Mr. Farleigh, that pepped me all up, simplicity of solid form, selection as the prime task of the artist, and made my laboured drawing feel awful! Nory and I were all full of vigour at noon that ebbed with the afternoon for my drawing then was just as dull, and less observant. Nory had a pain in her tummy, so that life looked a little gloomy till supper, which was fun as always, then off we went tonight to see "Top Hat" and laughed and laughed and laughed! We had to queue for half an hour. It was fun standing there on Haymarket, theatre lights behind and before, watching the lad do acrobatics in the middle of the street, and listening to desperately bad singing and even worse guitar music. We were impervious to hats and tin cups till one of the feeblest tenors rendered 'We may never meet again' and then we broke down and parted with a penny. As one of us said, 'If the fool had

sung "Be Still my Heart" he might have had a shilling'. When we came out of the theatre it was raining, and it felt just like all the movies of London, and the scene from Pygmalion, where they are standing waiting for a taxi in front of a theatre. We hate to go to bed, because each time means another day gone and they are going far too quickly".
"Oct. 24. I had fun today in Costume class, a great splashy water colour this norning, and a conte-and-wash this afternoon of the old man in the mediaeval robe, and I cleaned out my locker this morning and discovered that two weeks later, my life drawings don't look nearly so bad as I remembered them being. On such trifles does happiness depend. And book-binding is fun, even when it drags me out of the house (to night-school). I do enjoy learning new things".
"After being told by every instructor separately with diagrams, I'm gradually beginning to believe that my life drawings are lousy, over-worked, lacking solidity and construction. The criticism today left me not a leg to stand on. Everything was wrong, starting with size, working right through action and proportion and ending up with the modelling and detail. It's the most discouraged I've felt yet, but by gum I'm going to learn or bust".
"Monday. All day at school I simply slugged, putting heart and soul into trying to simplify my drawing, reduce it to the least common denominator, but keep it right, solid and forceful. I was still sweating over it this afternoon when the old boy with

the game leg came by and gave me a criticism that simply floored me! I haven't ever before been so taken aback by a criticism, a. 'careless', b. 'photographic', and he told me nicely that I musn't expect to draw well after one lesson or even two or three. It took a long time to learn. When I protested that I wasn't careless but I just couldn't draw slowly, he made a little allegory of the child learning to draw his alphabet ABC slowly and carefully first, so that eventually he could write them right off. I felt so discouraged and so misjudged that I wept, and spent the rest period, which mercifully followed, leaning out of the window with Nory, furtively wiping up my tears with her rather smudgy handkerchief. Lord I felt flattened, and still do. If after ten years, a man quite sincerely thought they were done by a beginner, what is the use?"
That was a bad day. We had dinner guests that night, friends of the Major's, and served steak that blew the budget for the whole week.
"I don't know whether I had eaten too much and drunk too much coffee, or whether two cigarettes in a row were too much for me, but after surviving the cocktails easily, and getting dinner ready, when it was finished I felt terribly dizzy, and absolutely unable to sit up, so I crawled into bed, and the coffee and the depression kept me awake and thinking of all the work I should be up and doing. Then mail came, three from Mother, one from Marge, and one from Grandfather and that was the end of the sleep idea. Mother had written me, as I knew she would, one thoroughly

reproachful and 'What have I done to deserve this?' letter when the days kept going and still no mail had come from England. I'm so thankful that the same mail brought her first answer to my letter from the boat....I don't know why I still feel so awful! Is it the criticism? Is it Mother's reproaches?, even when all is now forgave? Is it the gin? or the cigarette? or the question in my mind about whether Mrs. Balbernie knows how we love the Major, or the old unworthy wound of my envy of Nory, or even because I discover that his wife's name is Doris? Good heavens, what silly things to be low about! And the sum of them has quite swamped me".
We were due to spend the weekend in the Balbernie menage, at Beaconsfield, a village an hour or so away from London, and anticipated our visit there it in a fine state of eagerness and nerves. Nory was fighting flu, and I collapsed with it as soon as we returned, in spite of which we looked back on the weekend with pleasure. "I'm grateful to have seen him at home with the small sons and Mrs.B. I still hardly know what to think about her. I liked her in spots, very much. She was nice with the boys, interested enough to wrastle with them over hooked rugs, and passive under guinea pigs and kittens, and kindness itself with the small Sealyham, who licked my hand to my lasting gratification. But she does't speak our language at all, and the edge of some of her remarks to the Major seemed very thinly veiled...Since I've been thinking about it, I have felt perhaps that it was Mrs. B's misfortune rather than her fault, that she

just isn't the sort of person to understand the Major or to know how to play....I loved Sunday morning in the woods, Nory and I sketching till the pains in my middle were stronger than my industry, and I lay on my back in the woods, watching without attention the branches and few sere leaves blown against a grey sky, tracing the path of the ivy around the tree trunks and blissfully happy to listen to the Major's yarns of here and there. I liked too his remark to young Richard, 'If you fall and break your neck, will you remember to tell your mother that I strictly forbade you to climb that tree?', to which Richard agreed cheerfully. Both the children are darlings. Barry's smile goes all over, from blue eyes to wide mouth. It is his main social weapon. Richard smiles less but he's a grand youngster, and I thoroughly enjoyed rambling with him through the woods and along the lanes.
"After sketching, we walked on to the Royal Standard, second oldest pub in England, and if the day before had seemed unreal, this seemed quite fantastic, all the elements of an English three-act farce set up, one half-timbered inn front, one garden set with tables and chairs, one fence and hedge in front, all complete with Englishmen in plus fours and pipes and bright young things with clipped English voices...the side garden with apple trees, benches and old stone sculptures with the noses chipped off".
"Nov. 9, Eight youths singing, 'Good - night - Ba - Bee, Good - night - The milkman's on his way!' outside the window.

Cold inside, the kettle slowly heating for our hot water bottles, canvases on the 'blackened' hearth, presumably drying. George and Nory working in moody silence next door, where the gas has failed. We spent the afternoon at the exhibition of the London Group, a sufficiently interesting show, but to George at least, deeply distressing. I rather enjoyed it, and I was even thrilled to discover that three of the things at which I exclaimed in genuine approval were by Mr. Farleigh and Mr. Porter. Porter paints in a way of which I thoroughly approve, and seeing that he will be teaching me painting, that pleased me. Yesterday Nory and I went downstairs to see the painting class, and found an elegant nude model, a roly-poly negress, which thrilled us sufficiently to send us all over London, down streets with entrancing names, and through crowded ways after canvas &amp; stretchers. Last night I wrastled with them all evening and fell into bed weary and disgruntled. I was up early, ironing, setting breakfast, painting canvases, chaos, and then came mail, great heaps of it, two long letter from Mother, a fat one from Anne Marjorie, and a letter from Curry! We suspended operations and were deep into reading mail when the doorbell rang and I heard Nory coming with a visitor who turned out to be Mrs. Acheson, whom we both liked at sight. She's a darling! I didn't even mind our state of chaos. It was amusing and rather nice to hear her slow American voice over here and her "Do you have?". The last straw was when Miss Busbridge breezed in, all wild hair and mops and dusters in hand.

"Sunday, Nory and George went out for tea, a week too soon and arrived back just as I was boiling myself a humble egg, and then Kitty Jillings telephoned and Mickey, sounding even worse than I remember him, poor darling, with a nervous cough that sounds bad to me, but both thoroughly cordial, and I'm to go for tea and dinner a week from Sunday, and to meet a nice Scotch doctor, which pleases me. It specially pleases me to think of being on the "Downs" of Surrey, after soaking in poetry about Downs and uplands. I've been reading more poetry today. Both our new books have lovely things in them. Tonight I did some conte scribbles of George's room, the window with the washing hanging in front of it, the litter on the table, and the stove corner. They were fun to do, and like most drawings done for fun, look better than the laboured ones".
"Nov.11. It has been a Day. Nory and I were at Whitehall by 9.15 and already the crowd was piled up along the sidewalks. We joined it, and had an amusing hour watching bobbies make walls of themselves, seeing the guardsmen come by in their enormous busbies, with a carriage of such extravagant arrogance that we hugged ourselves in delight. They were beautiful to watch, arms swinging, shoulders high, chests fully out and their whole march a swagger. The air force lined up right in front of us with a precision that was alarming, but explained by the hatchet face of the officer in charge. They moved as one man, their rifles striking the ground with a single clap, and the perspiration

dripping down their callow faces and into their collars. The sun came out palely at firstf and then stronger and the day was beautiful, and just down the street the tower of Big Ben was a pale grey shape in the sky, and the buildings even directly opposite were hazy too. The tones were exquisite. Then the music began and we were thrilled to hear it, with the tones as rich and vibrant as a symphony orchestra, and the pipers high, shrill and piercing, yet terribly beautiful. I wish I had known the words to the Flowers of the Forest. I wondered if the Major was anywhere within earshot. Chopin's Funeral March was the one I loved best, and God Save the King. Then Big Ben chimed, the gun fired, and into a deepening silence came the eleven heavy booms of Big Ben. When it had finished the hush settled down like a physical presence over the crowd. I heard a rushing, rustling rattle, and looked up to find that it was the leaves of a little plane tree near. That somehow hurt more than anything, that the silence should be so complete that it let the leaves speak, probably the only time in the whole year when one could hear them in London. And then the words of '0 God our help in ages past', bringing a rush of associations, Malvern again, my children, St. Aidan's, home, and yet belonging so fittingly to the thoughts of Armistice Day that are world-wide. I could hardly sing it.
"We started painting today, and everything looked all right till I started putting body colour on. Then, as usual, all the vitality of my turps wash vanished".

November was a sombre month at Jubilee Place. Nory was having back-ache and depression, not helped by the doctor's advice that her back ached because she was so "tall and thin". George was spending more than he could afford, and we considered moving closer to the school to cut the cost of the bus travel.  I was discouraged about my work. The bright spot was our introduction to the Major's American friends, Ted and Elizabeth Acheson, young, sophisticated, travelled, and prepared to "keep an eye on us" for his sake. They lived in one of the charming renovated old houses that gave Chelsea its character. And Daphne and Gunther lived with them, two schnauzers, who, while obviously dogs, shared so many of the Acheson's social graces that they seemed more like people. Daphne spoke French, and Gunther English, with or without an American accent, and knew by the language used which of them was being addressed. Nevertheless, dark days, fog, and cold that clutched at the ankles and crept up through your clothes, kept us miserable, until we assessed the situation and took to vitamins as a substitute for sunshine. A test of stamina was provided by the bathroom down the hall. It had no fireplace and therefore no heat, and since it did have a gas heater to warm the bathwater, it had by law, a permanently open window which ensured that the temperature was at least as cold as out-of-doors. When you put your pennies in the slot of the gas heater you had a choice of a reasonable stream of warm water which could not warm the cold bath or you, or a thin trickle of very hot water. This was my choice, which gave me two

DAY AFTER DAY
The Achesons became increasingly important to us, calling at unexpected times with yellow mum or a bottle of sherry, sharing dog-games in the parks with us, and inviting us to decorate the walls of their little Chelsea dining room with our own fun murals. Ted's brother, Dean, was Secretary of State in Washington, and Elizabeth's father had been a prominent Episcopal bishop there. They knew everyone, and had good stories to tell about them. "I found Elizabeth upstairs, sitting at her window doing her nails, and enjoyed the sight of her. She's a beautiful person and a delightful one. Ted was shut up with his typewriter, but we interrupted him finally, and his welcome warmed me as always. It shocks me to realize how much I appreciate Ted's occasional way of saying, 'Doris would like this story' or some trivial thing like that. They came out with me, children (Daphne and Gunther) in tow, and we went down to the river, and I loved feeding the gulls. Ted is the most amusing companion. He talks happily, the greatest string of nonsense, and I am glad just to listen to it. I loved his idea of throwing Belle Anse, or whatever the indigestion tablets are called, alternately with the hard crusts. They were hard. As Ted said, 'They would enjoy that bread when the tide rose'. And I loved the sight of the graceful things, almost motionless till they

Mickey and Kitty, who had lived briefly next door to us in the big white house on Balsam Ave, were back in England, welcoming me to their home a few miles out from London. Mickey, who was struggling back from a nervous breakdown, seemed eager to show me the England he knew, the old, the picturesque. Kitty was grateful to see him roused from his apathy, and glad to send us off by bus to explore a village a dozen miles away or even further. I let him talk. He was jittery, but knew these fascinating corners of historic England, and seemed to shake off his depression as he guided me round them. After his ten years in the States and Canada, he was maddened by the conservatism of British business and its inefficiency, blaming much of it on the rigidity of the class structure in England.
"Tuesday - started terribly early with a dash to dress and meet Mickey at the coach station, and then we were off for the day, a grand day in many ways. The sun shone till afternoon, not bad for an English sun, and after we had passed all the suburbs, we came through some thrilling bits of English country-side, the trees mossy and ivy-twined, the hayricks top-heavy and thatched, and some marvellous old 'beamy' houses, as Mickey would put it. Bits I liked best were the Georgian house where Burne-Jones or someone lived, and the three beautiful flint houses in Rottingdean, the one with the smugglers' cave, and all the beautiful tiled roofs and lovely little gables and windows. And

the champagne! and the walk up over the downs with all the sherry and beer giving the place a rather dreamy quality, emphasized by the mists and tea in front of the fire, with the sea outside, and the little moment down beside the breakers".
"Thursday, Dec.5. Today has a rather grey look, with a patch of chocolate-brown depression about 3.30pm. I woke up this morning as usual, and remembered with a nasty sag the thing Nory said last night that hurt badly at the time and has been leering at me ever since. 'You're the most complacent person I have ever met'. It's all the things I hate in people, and it was like a slap in the face to be told that I am it. She was thoroughly in earnest too, and thought I was deliberately lying when I said that I didn't feel satisfied inside. Miss B. said the same thing, but I didn't mind that because she doesn't know me well enough to make a very searching judgement, but Nory ought to know me, and if she thinks so, it certainly must be the way I look on the surface. I'm so damned aware of the great areas in which I'm absolutely inadequate, and I've spent such a lot of this year already acutely aware of my deficiencies - all the times when Nory drew, and I just stood around beside her and felt grateful that when people came to her they automatically passed me. And that Ted and Elizabeth ask for me pleases me absurdly just because it's a constant surprise. I wonder if she doesn't guess how uncertain and inferior I have felt inside because of all that....It has upset me all the way in. Either I have been living in a fool's blindness as to my own self or she hasn't seen

very far underneath the surface... and another thing that stung was when she said 'You don't need to feel injured - I can feel you feeling injured', and that implied a sort of wounded vanity rather than anything else. Perhaps it is just wounded vanity. It's a hell of an unpleasant verdict, about as damning as any single word could be, and it's perfectly conscious. It wasn't just a casual phrase. I feel as if some props had been kicked away from under me. I don't know what to think or feel. Perhaps it's my own fault, because I've tried very hard to bury my hurts and shames, that Nory doesn't know I have them. And it's perfectly true that most of the time I am happy, and that just a half an hour before she said it, I had written to Marj. telling her that under any levels of gaiety or homesickness on Christmas Day I should walk serene, 'proudly friended'. Her faith in me and her love for me are a deep peace inside me, that gives me a kind of faith in myself....I wonder if she, who knows me better than anyone else, would agree to 'complacent'?"
"Farleigh said today that I was almost too slick in my water colour - I needed to think more of the drawing, ^perhaps it's just instinctive with you'. Yesterday, at the zoo Mr. Skeaping said to forget technique for a bit and begin to draw your thoughts. I remembered Lismer's 'Think a think and draw a line around it'...I feel as if I hadn't heard it or thought it since first year at OCA and it's the thing I need drilled into me most".

"I lay in bed this morning long past the appointed hour. My first look at the day showed a yellow ochre sky, the darkest day I've ever seen, and bed was far too good to leave. The darkness of today was like winter twilight all day long, and for breakfast we pulled the curtains over the brown filth outside and had the brightest lights, and I liked them."
"Sunday, Dec.8, It was fine when I propped open the first eye this morning, so I dressed in haste and made for Hampstead. When I came out of the underground the air seemed clearer, the sky brighter and the country heaps higher than in Chelsea. And up at the top of the hill, just before the little pond where the children were sailing their boats, was a Punch and Judy show, and I leapt to it, thrilled that my blighted youth should know fulfillment at this late date. It was grand fun. When Punch and the men were chasing each other and Punch kept popping out of the side or the back or anywhere except where the man was, the children jumped and shrieked in excitement. 'There he is! There he is!' And then when he cracked Punch over the head and turned to tell the children he was dead, they screamed at him, 'He moved. He's alive. There he is!' I was almost shrieking with them. They were lovely children, rosy-cheeked, alive - and their mummies and daddies and nurses were so amused that the whole group felt very friendly. I walked away on air. I wandered up and down the paths, muddy underneath with the dead leaves, and the great reaching arms of the trees far above. And then, when I finally found my way out, I was on a beautiful grassy clearing

with lovely old Kenwood House shining in the sunlight across the lawn, and the far lawn a high-keyed silvery green. My sketches are both disappointing, but on the way back I found heaps of other compositions, so I shall go back."
"Friday, Dec.13. I have enjoyed painting today, less because the results are good than because I appreciate so much Mr. Porter - both himself and his attitude to us, and what he is teaching us. Thank heavens I'm happy about the painting. It's the most important of all to me. This morning began badly enough with the alarm, but sometime afterwards hilarity descended. We woke George with a game of Bronco-busting and Nory playing hedgehog. Breakfast was riotous".
"Sunday Dec.15, We've just been checking Nory's horoscope with my diary, and it all spells applesauce. Sheer nonsense. But what a grand day it has been, so good that just an hour ago Nory and I were saying with tears in our voices, and watching the fire glowing on the bars, that every beautiful hour and place makes one more ache of regret at its ending, one more pain for some later day, that it cannot be recaptured. Never again, never again, not the three of us together, not both the Major and the Achesons, not this first glad surprise. Always from now on, London will mean not only joy in returning, but pain that the things and people that are so dear this year have changed or vanished".
For Nory and me, one of the pleasures of London was George's enjoyment of it. At Kensington Gardens, I reported,

"George was such fun. It was worse than the toy shop. First of all we lost him to the kites, and he stood with his hands in his overcoat pockets, bare-headed, oblivious to all but the small boys reeling them in or letting them unwind, as the wind took them up and up and up and up, some so high they were hard to find, and the string soon vanished into air so that they seemed to be floating of themselves. I wonder how long the boys have been saving cord from the parcels. Around the pond it was the sailboats that fascinated George, and the people and the beautiful gulls, their tails brilliantly white, their wings almost blue against the grey water and the greyer trees and buildings behind the pond. One old man sat on a bench, a dumpy shape with two brown and white puppies in his coat, just their inquisitive heads peeking out. There were many fair-haired, fair-cheeked children with sailor brimmed hats, gloved hands, and long legs under their tailored coats, and a few couples, one frankly walking with their arms around each other. We left George at a motorboat, and decided to let him catch us, but when we had reached almost the end of the park, and he was still glued to the side of the bench where the man was tinkering with it, and the crowd grew and faded and grew and faded, but still George stuck, we walked back to get the key, and George looked at us blankly, then came slowly recognition, and he returned in layers from some happy world known only to small boys and their ilk. Dear Round Pond, dear Kensington. 'The pleasantest club in London' surely.

"As if the day had not given us enough of joy to mull, Nory read the Readers1 Digest and relayed provocative bits while I wrote to David, and then we swapped jobs, and I stumbled across an article called "Over-compensation" that suddenly took me by the shoulders, shook me, said 'You fool! You can. Of course you can, and not only that, my child, the very fact that you are so damn scared of men and so wretchedly self-conscious with them when you most want to be happy, is the thing that will make your success a particularly howling one when you start*, and then George came and we plunged from there into a discussion on selfishness and the essential nature of man, primal instinct, and Lord knows what and so to bed".
"Dec 18. School over for the first term, celebrated by a good morning at the zoo, and a heavenly few minutes taking snaps of the penguins, and the man let me right in with them. The new ramp was slippery today, and there were hilarious minutes when he threw fish up to the top of the slope, and the little black and white chaps tried to get up, their absurd little legs going like mad, and skidding as fast as they went. Then when they did get up and seized the fish, they would stop running, and slide slowly down the slide backwards till they slipped off the edge and fell into the pool with a plop".

Elinor, from the "American Farmer" came to stay, for the Eve which we spent in front of the fire reading Dickens Christmas Carol aloud, and for the morning festivities of breakfast and parcels. Presents were few, and strictly budgeted, but carefully chosen. Nory and George had gone together to buy me Moby Dick, with the Rockwell Kent illustrations, still treasured for itself and the memories it conjures. "Cables had come for each of us, the dairy had left us an offering of cream. George's flute was played at once to our hugged, shared, joy. The top hat kept him guessing and trying in vain to get the clue from the music, da-da-da-da-dum-dum, and Nory found me the darling red Czechoslovakian slippers that I am wearing now, and wiggling my toes in with delight, and Elinor liked her snaps, and Nory liked her book"
"Leaving Elinor comfortable, there were not three happier children in all of London than we as we sallied forth, George with the goldfish, Nory with an offering of champagne for the Major, Doris with an Oxo bag full of oddments. And it was like a benediction on our departure to have Miss Busbridge's head in its wild morning frenzy, pop out of the bathroom window on the second floor, and hear her "Get a Day Return!" abruptly, above the bells. All the way up Jubilee Place we heard the chimes, nearer, farther, soft and confused, clearer. The air was distantly full

of them and the clouds were bright and broken to let blue sky through. The goldfish splashed, George dripped, and we laughed".
Gathered at Beaconsfield when we arrived, besides the Balbernie family whom we had met in November, there was Mrs. Wheeler, the Major's mother, an alert grey-haired woman who ran her late husband's importing business in the City, and Kitty, his sister, who shared our adoration of Arthur, and embraced us as kindred souls.
"And the amazing dinner table! The room was hung with great red and green garlands, the table literally hidden under pyramids of Christmas crackers, blue, red, green, gold, silver, cellophane and patterned, with Mrs. Balbernie sending Nory and me down beside the Major, which made us happier than the mere joy of being near him because it was a gesture of sympathy and generosity. And besides grand turkey there was champagne and a toast to the two dears, Major and Mrs. B. and such a pulling of crackers as I have never seen before, dozens for each, crack -bang - crack, with laughter every time, and us three pulling double sometimes and caps appearing, and false noses, and novelties and fireworks, and more and more laughter - then the pudding! There never was such a pudding - never, never, never. It's my most favourite pudding forever, with a great thick cluster of holly in it, and blue flames leaping around it, and then such grand bits of things inside. A wedding ring first for the Major. "Doris," says he to his wife, "It's true". And then, oh horrors, a thimble for me, which I quick covered up again with

pudding and gave a loud moan. After the commiseration had subsided I prepared for the worst and quick dived for it, and there was a handle on top, which made it a BELL. Could anything be more fitting or auspicious than an apparent thimble which turns out as a bell? And then Doris B's sister produced a threepenny bit for Nory, and the party grew gayer and gayer and we all felt marvellous".
We listened together to the "Empire Broadcast", on radio of course. "The best fun was that every solitary person who spoke in any of the ten centres seemed to have relations in Canada, and sent greetings to Aunt Ella and Uncle Willie and the cousins. It became quite absurd. Our whole ten millions must be cousins or aunts or uncles. The King sounded distressingly husky, as if each word was an effort, either physically or emotionally, and then we stood at attention while God Save the King was sung, and I watched the flame of the fire and followed the voices from England to Scotland to Wales to Ireland, and we sat down, still thinking of Mother and Grandfather listening at home, Marjorie and Roy, the Beers, all the hosts of them".
Mrs. Wheeler asked us at one point in the afternoon, if we three all came from the same village. Suddenly we realized how blank was her picture of Canada. I explained that we all came from the same place, but that it was big, seven miles from home to work. "How do you get there?" And I found myself telling her that I paddled along the lake past the Indian encampments to get to Central Technical School, and Nory assured her that the wolves

hardly ever came down Yonge St. Kitty swallowed the story of the side-hill gouger from snout to tail, and commented, "Do you know, the more I hear about Canada, the more fascinating I think it is". Later, I sent Mrs. Wheeler a tourist brochure, with coloured photographs of our sky-scrapers and other urban marvels, with an apology for having teased her. But I suspect she will still believe in the campfires on the shore of Lake Ontario.
"On the underground tonight, a stout pleasant-looking woman whistled to her husband when the seat beside her was vacated, and he, a funny broad-faced man with little blue eyes behind very thick glasses, squirmed through to her, saying to us in passing, 'the mating call' ".
"We have just welcomed the New Year, flinging open the window on Kings Road to the bells, and pledging us, our dear ones, everybody, and lastly the Major, in our own sherry, with our Christmas cake ceremonially cut! Rather a sweet new year".

NEW FIELDS
Early in January I took off for a weekend in Paris with Kathleen Hilken, an English girl who had been with me at the Ontario College of Art, and now lived in London.
"Jan 11. Very early. In the railway carriage at Dieppe. In one corner K across from me. In the other corner a strange woman, who is English but can understand a very voluble French porter, and in my corner with me, that awful thick, light feeling of having been wakened in the best part of one's first deep sleep. (There are sounds of departure occurring outside, doors slamming, gentle arguments in French, a squeaking luggage cart being pushed up the platform, the dead echo that is part of railway stations at night). K and I met promptly at 7:45 under the big clock at Victoria, fairly incoherent with excitement, and got our little ticket folders with the tricolour stripe and were actually off, in a corridor train, with the moon outside the window, swept by madly tearing clouds. In an incredibly short time we were at New Haven on the dock, charmed by the tiers of lighted windows and the quiet hill-shapes dark against the sky, and there was our boat, 'The Paris[', and soon we were on it, and oh, the dear sweet feel of a deck again, the thrill of seeing the moonlight on the wind-patterned bay, the two harbour lights, green points in a green moonlit darkness. And the first thrilling moment out in the bow when Beachy Head was a dim moonlit shape in a bright starlit sky, the light turning, the

waters wide, restless and silver in front of it, with the moving shapes of black gulls against it, and then the motion of the boat, the roll up, the sag back, the roll up, with the railing way down at our feet one minute and high against the stars the next, and sometimes I had to crouch and brace my feet to stop me from pitching forward, and K hung on to the railing and I hung on to her. We watched the tall mast waving slowly against friendly Orion and his ilk, and the sky was soft blue dusk above our heads. Downstairs, in the sleeper that amused me so much at first and made me feel like cattle or something out of a continental book, I lay with my eyes closed, just luxuriating in the familiar toss from one side of the bunk to the other, feeling myself rocked by the waves, not even minding the minutes when the screw came out of the water and spun around with such force that our bunks shook as if we were in a terrier's teeth. There was even the familiar rattle of the electric light. I half listened for the piano behind my head, and Winnipeg and the Major guffawing down the corridor. Immediately after that, not the round bath steward, but the stewardess was waking me and I was staggering through the simplest possible arising rites and up into the night. Customs, passport, porter to the train, all in a sort of pleasant half-understood daze, and any moment the train will start".
It started with a jerk and jiggled us through the night to Gare St. Lazare. "Just across from the station we found a cafe and had brioche and cafe au lait, and then, amused by the dark

emptiness of the streets, we started out in what we thought was the direction of the Louvre. The only signs of life were a rare light in an attic. I wondered if it was some neurotic artist in an orgy of work, or some writer drinking himself to death. We walked down street after street, skirting groups of ashcans, and feeling the rain come on. First I changed into my heavy shoes, a bit later into my beret, and then on we walked. The Madeleine was a beautiful dusky pile in the darkness. We walked all around it, looking for K's old hotel, but in vain, then on down past l'Opera, and eventually, wetter and wetter, to the huge desert of the Place de la Concorde. There we walked miles over puddles, into puddles, our arms aching with our bags, discovering L'Orangerie, discovering the Seine, trying to find someone in that great wet, lamplit blank to ask directions of. At last, hours later, we arrived at Hotel du Rhone, damp, tired, but still pleased with life, and oh the comfort of that awful little room with the violent roses on the wall paper, and the violent yellow bedspreads. When we got up at 9.00 am and went to the window and looked out into the vault there was blue sky overhead, so we dashed out. Breakfast was fun, cafe and croissants at a little table outside, watching the gendarmes with their capes, the Frenchmen with their beards, and enjoying their frank stares. I did like the Flemish show. The portraits have the same quality I love so much in photographs of the time of Mother and Grandmother's youth. They were exquisitely drawn, extremely simple, and quiet in both modelling and colour. Van der Weyden's

had a spiritual quality and directness of eye that seemed the very essense of the best of Flemish art. It made me wonder why we use so much paint and so much frenzy to say so little".
We crammed that precious weekend full, managing to include even the Follies Bergere, which in those days depended on music and dancing as well as on nakedness. "The moment we had fought our way in the door we were captured by the gaiety of the theatre. The entrance was a huge cafe with house-fronts on all sides, awnings, a great wide staircase, tables and a bar. The show itself moved with colourful music and fun all through. I adored the naked dancers. They had all the allure possible and still were artistic instead of vulgar. The girls were beautiful, superb figures, all pink and white and blooming in the strong lights, their hair uniformly golden, feet beautiful, lovely breasts and hips. They were delights to look at - and had they SA!. No matter what the scene, what the costumes, it was beautiful". It was the memory of that show that took me back to the Follies thirty years later. This time there was no talent, no imagination, only nakedness, and we were bored and disgusted.
"Then to the Louvre - and it was a revelation to me. The entrance is vast, white, modern, with a wide flight of flat white steps, and at the top, alone, and imposing by its very position, is the Victory of Samothrace, poised, as it was supposed to be, on the prow of a ship. We walked through hundreds of long galleries, slipping on the polished hardwood floors, before we finally found the French moderns. Renoir at last has some

meaning for me. There were two of his that were in the flecked light that comes through trees, beautiful things, and some heads that were alive with character. He was my big discovery of today. There are fine things of Manet and Monet too and some charming Corot, so much like Canadian painting that I felt he was speaking my language".
Back to London and hard work at school. "Jan. 18, The King is ill. The wireless news was not particularly reassuring, and we saw a man's paper on the bus tonight saying that his heart was a little weaker. It seems possible that it is the end. It's strange to think of it and to realize how deeply affectionate and concerned everyone in London and England and the Empire feels. He's so much more than a symbol. The prince must dread his death, from every point of view. Kipling died early this morning, and the newspaper memoirs of his life and writings have been reminding me of how much more he was than just a British Jingoist"
Three days later King George the Fifth died. The bulletins had hardly appeared on the boards before every shop on our bus route to the Central School, Sloane St, Knightsbridge and Piccadilly, was stripped of colour and draped entirely in black and purple. I left school for Temple Bar to see and hear Edward the Eighth proclaimed king. "I went in the general direction as fast as I could walk, and found myself following others through Lincoln Fields Inn to Bell Yard Rd. where it joins Fleet St. There I stayed, jammed into a crowd, and grateful for the little

mirror that let me see quite decently into the centre of the street. Without it, all I could see in front of me was bowler hats. It was a very sober crowd. Heaps of the men were in black ties. All the women who were on the balconies of the buildings opposite were in black, and the city has worn a subdued air that is the result of real affection and sincere grief. There was no badinage and little conversation in the crowd. It was all difficult to see, but there was much arriving of be-tasselled coaches with coachmen in silk hats, and beautiful men in red uniforms with great cascades of white feathers in the helmet, and the horse guards resplendent in shining silver and red and white, and heralds in little gold caps, gold tunics with braid right across their tummies, blowing a flourish of trumpets on long silver horns. I could see the judges or whoever they were, in white silk wigs and dark robes. And I could hear someone calling a loud challenge 'Who's there?' to the procession as it approached the boundary of the old 'City'. Then it passed, and in a few minutes, far away and hard to understand, after another double flourish of trumpets, came the proclamation itself. I could distinctly hear his name, 'Edward - Albert - Christian -George - Andrew - Patrick - David'. I thought of Marjorie, and how we used to string off those names. And then there was cheering and God Save the King, played very slowly, and with people singing softly but in such numbers that it sounded like the moaning of wind, all around, deep and very powerful. And the trumpets again, and the horse guards moved away".

The next day I stayed at an upstairs corner window of the school "watching the line of people along the sidewalk get thicker and thicker till even the wide pavement outside the bank was too full to allow anyone to pass. And the street was lined with bobbies almost shoulder to shoulder, and the mounted men rode up and down the edge of Hart Street, pressing back the crowd. When they stopped cross-traffic and let the people fill Hart Street, the line of bobbies was almost carried off its feet and had to fight them back with their shoulders. Then taxis and lorries filled the road and people swarmed all over them. It was a dark crowd, in black, and a very quiet one. The actual procession came with extraordinarily little announcement and in silence, half a dozen mounted men, the line of mounts drawing the gun carriage with the bier, covered with the gold flag and the red lion, with a small crown and a single cross of flowers. That was all. Behind it came the prince, King Edward Vlll, walking in a distressed sort of way as if his feet hurt, and beside him Lord Harewood and the Duke of York. After them, the cabinet, all bare-headed, all dressed in black and very quiet. Another set of mounted guards and the palace guard in busbies and grey overcoats on either side, and that was all". This was the cortege from Kings Cross station to the lying in state in St. Paul's Cathedral. The actual funeral I eventually saw on the screen of the local cinema.

"Fri. Feb.14, A cable from David today - 'Kindling delivered September' and I'm so glad for her. I had to walk right out and send a cable back and nothing I could think of sounded pleased enough. I'm so glad I'll be home before the baby comes and I keep wondering why I'm so sure it's to be a girl. I never think of girls - and yet this time I do.
"Today Mr. Porter introduced me to his way of doing water-colours, a new way to me, leaving all your lights white and modelling the rest in a high key, with a brush that's practically dry. I wonder if that's how Kath Cooley (Kennedy) was taught to paint."
"Feb.17, Yesterday we had a new pose and I plunged into it full of confidence and determination to use all the things Mr. Porter had taught me and I slapped the paint on, and had a grand time. And he said'good', and better than that, I_ said "good'. I went down to look at it today and it's still good! That makes it worth all the sweating and cursing I've done to date. If only I can keep the vitality and freshness when I work further into it. I had the best time yesterday. I wish it were always first day at a pose".
"I've seen crocuses before in Trinity College grounds, and even on Spruce Hill Road, but here - not just a few valiant little bits of colour, but the whole earth seems to open out and burst into bloom".
And it wasn't just the crocuses. March came with birdsong and sunshine, and found me capitulating to Mickey's need

of me, to the flattery of his attentions, and the sweetness of being in love in London in the spring. Kitty sent us here and there with her blessing, eventually for an idyllic few days together on the Isle of Wight, where we walked hand in hand on the chalk downs, high above the sea, and later for a full week to the Isle of Man. My memories of those months are grateful, full of tenderness and pain, knowing always that this was for now, and not for the rest of my life. Mickey rationalized our "affair" as good for me, because it enlarged my experience as a woman and therefore as an artist. I rationalized it as good for both Kitty and Mick because it brought him out of a long period of apathy and depression which had threatened their marriage more than I did. Nory and I talked it out, and she forgave me, the more easily that she was still carrying in her heart the girlhood idol with whom she had been travelling when he was arrested, and who was still serving a term for bank robbery in America. The Major and the Achesons raised no eyebrows, and kept their thoughts to themselves, perhaps understanding my need better than I did myself.
"We sat on the sea-wall tonight and watched the exquisite silver thread of the moon in the sky and the faint glow of warmth at the horizon. A sky that was the blue of a Japanese print was reflected in the patches of water between the chalk humps on the low-tide strand - dear low tide, that I have loved so wistfully and so deeply. Thank God Mickey can see things. We were walking very slowly down the shore when suddenly he stopped and said "My

God" or the equivalent in a stricken kind of voice, and I stopped short, stricken in turn and wondering what was the matter. It was specially sweet to find that it was the sheer beauty of the cliff and lights and rooftops at the end that had stopped him". I told Mickey that night that I should never see the thread of a new moon without thinking of him, and I never have.
"March 21, This morning Nory and George and I walked up to Hyde Park and through it in search of spring, and it was there - crocuses in thick clusters around the trees, people sculling on the Serpentine, and the three of us lying on the grass in the sun, with lacy English branches against a pale blue sky, and Nory and I acknowledging homesickness for out dear north country. This morning I felt what exile could be, how I would cry with longing for the feel of a paddle in my hand, the warmth of flat Georgian Bay rocks, the cool ripple of blue water".
"May 4. Saturday, Skeaping took us to Whipsnade for a magically short day of wandering around the woods there, drawing kangaroos, looking at the tigers, and lying in the sun on the side of the hill, marvelling at the loveliness of the country stretching below us, from soft silvery green to softest blue, and patterned with hedged fields. I ran my hand over the yielding yet resilient grass and felt a little more peace in my heart.
"And then I came home to a huge sheaf of iris, and my heart sang inside me and I felt a great burst of joy and thanksgiving. I see them last thing at night and first thing in

the morning, and they are on our tea table and our rooms are full of them".
Tues. May 5, Nory and I cut wood blocks and played a grand game this afternoon called, What are the six best things in life? I read her the article from the Express this morning, and in the bus by myself, I decided that the two very best were walking in the woods, and being loved, in that order. I think even life without love would be better than life without quietness and beauty out of doors. Nory and I listed things. Poor darling. Dancing with Ron is still her idea of heaven. I wonder how much of her heart he still has. From the little things she has said today and last night, I imagine most of it".
"I came home Saturday and found Marjorie's letter. It was almost too much for me. I cried, and every time I read it, it makes me cry. My darling M - if you could only know what your faith does to me, and to have her glad that love has come to me instead of all the things that anyone else would be, just finished me. Bless her, bless her. How can people live without a Marjorie?
"Sunday, May 24, a day that I am glad to have lived. We went to Kew on faith, complete with sandwiches, and found ourselves in a world that was too beautiful to be borne. The trees were great spreading, rich things, no two alike in colour, green Caucasian cedars, copper beeches that Nory and I went under into a golden deep gloom, and every leaf was a separate shiny green and copper marvel. And the whole tree varied from being

red to green to deep purple as we saw it from different angles... And the laburnum, cold green yellow as a singing relief to the masses of brilliant pinks and rosy colours and purple of the rhododendrum. They were beyond description, beyond belief, and beyond remembrance. We were drunk on them. The mad glorious riot of their bloom, the startling viridien of their perfect coldly beautiful green leaf whorls, the shock of the buds, every separate bit too exquisitely perfect in form for anything but a design, and the gardens flaming with them. And I thought about it being Victoria Day at home, and perhaps the chilluns' camp, and thought too that only the steady pain kept me from being perfectly happy, and I wondered if I should miss the pain if it should ever go".
"May 27, Zoo this morning was a joy as usual. How I adore that place! I was drawing polar bears for the Major, and one of my gloves fell into the den and was gnawed by a large and dirty polar bear who pulled the fingers till they snapped back, lots of fun! I had such a good time there that I skipped lunch and had a beetroot salad at Lyons. Definitely, Nory and I cannot draw. My life drawing today touched a new low, and I would be in complete despair but for Mr. Tomlinson's kind word of encouragement, that a real low precedes a jump. Pray that the jump may come soon!"
"A simple thing like stretching one fractious canvas has put me into such a foul temper that I'm fit for nobody's company and am in exile for the good of the family. A pity,

because till now it was a very good day. Nory did her first really good life drawing, which made the day somewhat special.
"Wonder what Dad would have thought of it all. I'm sure he would have understood and still believed in me - almost sure that he would have been worried about it all. I have no idea what his advice would have been except that I remember his words. ' It' s your life. You must live it your own way'. How I was lucky, blessed beyond measure to have such a father".
One bright June morning I was walking down Southampton Row, on my way from the school to buy art supplies, when I saw striding up the street towards me a familiar figure, tall, rangy, hair blowing in the wind - Arthur Lismer! We met in a great embrace, and walked together "arm in arm and trying in five minutes to exchange the news of a whole year". Lunch at Selfridges with Mrs.Lismer and daughter Marjorie was good for more gossip, and I was included in the theatre party at "Glamorous Night", the Ivor Novello musical, that was made far more glamorous for me by being with the Lismers.
"Wed. June 10, only two more days left, and I didn't do a single decent scratch today. But I had a good afternoon. Mr. Grant took me down to the library for a course on Degas and a talk for the good of my soul. He said that being this good I should be much better, that my drawings were worse than bad because they are mediocre, that I need more sensitive perception. My hand is OK, it's my eyes and brain that are failing. He told

me to use charcoal for a while, to have some fun, to do bad drawings if it turned out so, to feel more".
Kitty and Mickey and their two children were all moving back to Canada in the summer, to settle in Vancouver. I joined them for a few days before they went, for a long weekend playing with Robin on the seashore, walking all together on the Downs, picnicking among gorse bushes, and, being, astonishingly, comfortable together. Kitty was warm and relaxed. I admired her and liked her immensely. That made it easier to say goodbye to them, with my pain at parting from Mick a small price to pay for what they had given me.
"Wed. June 24. Today (at the zoo) began well in front of the chimps,, in the big open cage, then in the Fellows' Garden with John (since noon) Skeaping sitting in a deck chair, glowing in the sunlight, and talking Life and Art, about the need of emotional and mental self-realization, and I told him I felt a need for greater growth before I would have anything to say, and he said that people whose lives had been explosive were more readily able to impress their personalities on their work, and we looked across the green level grass to the two camels, startling in the sunlight, with a multi-coloured procession of children passing in front of them, and talked of the importance of seeing things as if for the first time, freshly". Later, I sat by myself in front of the polar bear cage and reviewed the many different ways in which my teachers had given me the same verdict, remembering way back when Miss Dafoe had explained my

	HOME AGAIN
We bought a car, a red "Humber" for one hundred dollars. It's hard to believe. For six weeks we explored England and Scotland, using H.V.Morton's In Search of Britain as our Bible along the way, our only mechanical trouble a windshield wiper blade that needed replacement. Our passage home was booked on a ship that left from Manchester, and the day before we embarked George negotiated a sale of the car for seventy-five dollars.
Our ship was another freighter, but carrying only ten passengers, and with very little deck space. The tiny lounge doubled as the dining room. One of our fellow-passengers was Helen Crichton, head of the Domestic Art department at Central Tech, whom we already knew well and liked. Four others were Barker Fairley who was on his way to take over the German department at the University of Toronto, and his wife and teen-aged family. Barker was already interested in art, but had not yet begun his second career as a distinguished Canadian painter. The company was congenial, but provided none of the high drama and excitement of our passage to England. "Monotonous days at sea" was my description of our voyage until the pattern was broken by the sight of land, icebergs, porpoises and whales all in a single morning. "As soon as I went out on deck it was different. There was a Cunarder near us, and I leaned over the rail and watched her and counted her decks enviously, then went

aft with Mr. Fairley and talked Georgian Bay and paddling, hungrily, till a sailor laddie ran up and rang the bell, saying 'Iceberg off the port bow'. We tore to see it, and watched it grow from a light speck to a lovely fairy creation of white and green shadows. We were still at breakfast when someone shouted 'Land' and we ran up the corridor and out all the doors at once, and passed the glass from one to another and shook hands on it, and were very gay. And while we were still congratulating each other on seeing land, someone noticed porpoises popping in and out of the water too quickly for me to see anything but the splashes - and then someone, young Bill, called out 'Whales' and there on the other side of the ship, port, was a whole school of them, lazily showing their great dark slippery bodies with the pointed tails, and blowing and spouting.
"And lastly there was Newfoundland, an irregular low blue shape in the distance. And it's sunny! And the ship has stopped heaving! And the Fairley family have recovered! And I'm going home. I haven't dared to think about it too much. Since Sunday we have had day after day much the same, strong head winds the whole time, the ship pitching and tossing, pitching and tossing, hours on the deck wrapped up tight but cold in spite of it, reading, watching the waves rolling past, grey or green or blue or black, dozing perhaps, thinking long hours about whether Mickey will meet me in Montreal and deciding 'no', playing bridge in the cabin and going to bed at 9.30. I can't believe two passages could be so different".

That night we finished the second bottle of the Major's farewell gift of wine, with much ceremony. Then we put into each bottle a letter to him, wrapped in a request that the finder use the enclosed ten cents to mail it. We dropped them gently into the sea, and eventually both letters reached him in England.
When we docked in Montreal Mother was there to meet me with Ken, who had come up from the States specially to drive her down. Mickey was there too, which just seemed to complicate life. We couldn't talk. Mother acknowledged him coolly. In a few meaningless minutes we had greeted and parted, with Ken bearing Nory and George and Mother and me off to Uncle Charlie's for dinner.
Reaching Toronto meant Marjorie, who had come in from Brampton to welcome me, very pregnant, very happy, and being everything that it meant to me to be home. She stayed with me that night, and we slept, as we had so often slept through the years, wrapped in each other's arms.
My CGIT group had set up a camp for the Labour Day weekend, a dramatic demonstration of their maturity, to which I was admitted without having to take any responsibility. I was still too disoriented to feel part of it.
"Sept. 13, that date sounds familiar. I wonder - suddenly I don't - It's a year ago today that we left, and I'm almost as unhappy now as I was happy then... Mother seems very miserable. She was fine in Montreal when she met me, all right while Ken was here. At first I thought she was tired, then I thought she was

cross at me for having gone to camp. Now I don't know what it is, and I wish I could do something to help her".
The "kindling" was safely delivered, and for a short time Marjorie stayed at her mother's. "Oct.3, I went down the hill this morning and landed in to the Beer household in a state of chaos, Mrs. B. in curlers, Marjorie in pyjamas, Harry (her brother) in pyjamas, Anne Eleanor in tears because she was hungry, so I superintended her bath, funny little long purple thing, and watched her fed, and gossipped a bit and then home."
In many ways it was a grim fall. Mother was silent or curt. Grandfather and Grace were affected by her ill-humour, although we three were comfortable together. But the news was bad. "Jim Hunter (newscaster) reporting on the war in Spain, Mully (at CTS) prophesying fascism in U.S., Quebec talking secession, Edward's abdication".
Eventually, in desperation, I broke into Mother's silence, and discovered the reason for it. The weekend that I had been at camp with my "Shawnees", Mother had dipped into my diary, and discovered the whole horrible truth about Mickey and me. She had been devastated, to the point of taking her prayer book up to Dad's grave in Mount Pleasant Cemetery and reading the burial service for me as for one dead. For three months her anger had been fermenting, and the explosion was violent.
"Jan.1,1937 Something has gone out of writing in my diary, perhaps for ever. After the first ghastly horror of my Christmas eve talk with Mother, when her hysterical grief was so

much worse and more bitter even than I had feared, God what hell Christmas was this year, from time to time since, in with the sick ache of pity for Mother and worry for the future, there has been a feeling of shame and outrage that anyone should have read my diary. It was a damnable trick - worse than peeking through keyholes. Nobody but God has any right to a person's inmost thoughts".
After Christmas I escaped to Haliburton, but my heartache for Mother went with me. "How I dread going home. I sat under a thick spruce this afternoon, watching the snow blowing past against cedars and river and hill, and thought that for the first time in my life I hate being alone, because as soon as I am alone the pain that is never far under, is raging through me on the surface again. And probably Mother feels the same, and yet is inevitably alone much more than I am. It's only when I'm with people that I can forget it even for a few minutes. Poor Mother. I think if she knew how miserable and how helpless I feel every time I think of her, she might be a little revenged. I'd rather suffer the hurt than be the cause of it to someone else. That's a far worse punishment. She understands so little. If only she could once know what someone else feels about something. And I suppose she never will. She could even read my diary without understanding it, which makes me hot every time I think of it. How it stings to think of her reading and distorting everything she read. Sometimes I could almost hate her for having read it. Mostly I feel too sorry for her to hate her, and she's terribly

important to me. She's so much of my world. And I can't forget her for one minute or get rid of the pain of having hurt her so terribly".
Ken wrote to me from Toledo, "I don't know or care what you have done, had a baby or married a Jew, but you should never write anything down that you are not prepared to hear read out in court". Feeling, too late, the force of his ironic advice, I mutilated my journal, cutting away whole sections, and erasing every incriminating passage in which I had used Mickey's name.
Unable to help Mother myself, I told Doctor Cotton the story, and asked him to talk to her. "Jan.7, I spent the last hour this afternoon in Dr. Cotton's office, and I feel now as if there were another strong hand in mine. He was dear and quiet and understanding and so sane. He and Ken have helped me back to a little sense of balance that I much needed".
For Mother, however, Dr. Cotton's visit was the last straw! My guilt was now known, and she could never hold up her head in public again!
"Jan. 13 Last weekend at Brampton was lovely. The baby laughed out loud. I went up with Roy to the high school to look over the Peel County picture collection".
A week later Grace and Grandfather and I stood on the platform of the Union Station and saw the train pull out, taking Mother and her friend Mrs. Young off to Florida for a break that we all needed badly. We watched it disappear down the track, and then looked at eachother, the smiles spreading.

"Let's go to a movie", said Grandpa. I've forgotten what we saw, but I have never forgotten the three of us sitting around the kitchen table after midnight because nobody was sending us to bed, having a festive snack, and a leisurely gossip. Grace had decided to stay the night because it was such a special occasion.
"Let me see", said Grandpa a few days later. "Tomorrow is Tuesday, and the next day is Wednesday, and on Thursday your mother will have been away a week, and the next Thursday it will be two weeks, and the Thursday after that, three weeks. How time flies!" Far too quickly for us.
I looked back on those weeks as a holiday. "And on one of our many nights at home together, in the corner of the livingroom, reading detective stories and trying not to hear the radio, Grandfather got to his feet and coughed, and said that he was going down to look at the furnace, 'In case I might miss him if he went out without saying goodbye.' He is such a lamb. It's a shame Mother doesn't enjoy him. She could have such pleasure in living with him if she were a little more appreciative of his humour and a little more patient when he is forgetful or critical".
Grace went up to town with him one day when he was needing new shoes. Grace loved that. She was proud of being seen with this distinguished-looking old gentleman. But she didn't know which way to look when the clerk in Eaton's shoe department asked what he was looking for, and Grandfather said with a twinkle, "They must be comfortable for dancing, and they must please her".

His eighty-fifth birthday fell during Mother's absence. We told him that Cousin Florrie was coming down for afternoon tea so he spruced himself up for the occasion. She was a part of the Levis connection, a niece of whom he was very fond. Towards the end of the afternoon he whispered to me to ask Grace if it would be all right to invite her to stay for dinner. "Yes, indeed" And the Jenkings and Mrs. McGill arrived together shortly afterwards, to his surprise and delight. Mother's friends loved Grandpa and enjoyed being with him.
"We all got terribly hilarious and the cake was perfect, a circle of candles and HAPPY EIGHTY-FIFTH BIRTHDAY on it, and a rose in his button-hole, and cocktails and beer and a general air of festivity".
Florida and Mrs. Young had been good for Mother. She came home refreshed, comparatively civil to me, and wanting to send us off for a holiday as soon as school was over. So Grandfather had the satisfaction of showing off Montreal and Quebec to the fresh and appreciative delight of Grace who had never travelled before.
"Quebec, June 30, In Montreal Grandfather was indefatigable. He took us round and round the city, naming every building as we came to it. And tonight we walked on the Terrace and climbed the steps below the Citadel and stood in the sunshine looking down to Lower Town and over the river while the band played. This place has such quality. Here in Levis I find a

character I had not expected that I like very much. I wonder how many of these grim little frame houses have such charm within. I love the funny old-fashioned furniture and Aunt Pussy, and Uncle Jack's simplicity and kindness and the way Grandpa settles right in to being at home."
I was the driver of course, but Grandpa was the one who decided, about eleven o'clock in the morning, that I should have a rest, and saw the right tavern to stop at, where he and I could have a beer and Grace the innocent drink of her choice. Part of the ritual was for me to leave the second half of my bottle for him to finish. We all had a lovely time!
Early in July I left for my first experience of the west. Marjorie's sister, Eleanor, could not join me until later, but we planned to meet in Jasper and go on together. Depression travel was primitive but cheap! I went "colonist" in a car with black leatherette seats that made up into berths at night, and a stove at one end for preparation of food. Usually I bought a good breakfast in the dining car, still gracious with linen tablecloths and finger bowls. My other two meals were sandwiches bought in haste at station counters.
My goal was the YMCA camp near Jasper, where I was to wait for Nor and get some mountain painting. The first morning I wakened to see a bear looking in the opening in the tent-flap. I assumed that if he was on the loose, he was tame. At any rate, he ambled off.

Briant, Don and me in camp. We were sitting at our simple midday meal when we heard a few irregular noises outside, a growl and a shout. We three laid down our forks and knives without a word, pushed back our chairs and dashed to the window where we saw Max, the stout cook, half way up the roof of the cook house and a HUGE brown bear and her cubs tearing at some big bones of raw meat. It was pretty exciting for a bit".
A few days after our arrival, six of us went by car, small boat and a twelve mile hike through the woods, to Maligne Lake, to stay overnight in the tent hostel there. That evening the warden of the park invited me to his cabin to meet his wife, who was a painter and starved for someone to share it with. I let the others go back without me and send me my sketching gear, while I moved in with Charlie and Mona Matheson and small Glenn. What an experience, two weeks learning to know the lake and the mountains that circle it with people who belonged in that world and loved it.
The Mathesons came out with me when it was time to return to camp. We travelled by horse train, another wonderful first for me! That night I wrote, "I crawled into bed, and just as I hit - suddenly it hurt - and the blessed soreness took me right back into this morning, three golden lovely singing hours on the trail riding down from Maligne with a swinging movement that sometimes was almost like dancing, and the sun hot on my back, Mona and Charlie ahead on Saucy and Pilot with old black Mrs. Snaith trudging along and the bad brown Friendly stopping to

graze, or turning aside, or biting Mrs. Snaith's rump until Charlie broke off a gad or slapped his rear end with his reins -and away at the back, almost too happy to bear it, came Doris on White Cloud, placidly following, with a rare trot to catch up to the others and give me a chance to ride 'western' without posting".
Nor arrived as scheduled and was so thrilled with Jasper that I forbore to compare it with Maligne. We went on together out to Prince Rupert, and down to Vancouver by boat. There we parted briefly. She had a heart interest to test, and I wanted to visit Florrie at her apple ranch in the Okanagan. When we re-met it was to begin our three weeks camping on the summit of Mount Revelstoke. Curry had pioneered this with one of her students the year before. The parents of this student lent us what we needed, and drove us up through dense fog to the square, glass-sided lookout cabin that was to be our headquarters.
"Up and up in the truck, through clouds, seeing glimpses of the town, of other mountains, through huge timber with hanging branches, past four-mile cabin, eight-mile cabin, all the cabins, up and up till there was just scrub growth, and dear little Balsam Lake, and then the lookout ahead, perched like a red and white doll's house on the very top". The clouds that were covering our mountain gradually thinned and began to dissipate, opening up views of mountains and the valley of the Columbia River, fresh marvels with each gap in the clouds. We pitched a tent on the meadow below to satisfy the technicalities, but we

ate, slept and worked in the main room of the lookout. On weekends, town visitors and tourists moved freely across us and up into the tower. The rest of the time we were left in peace, with a daily call from the warden of the park to bring us mail and supplies and drink the good coffee we brewed. Our duty was to watch for fires and report them.
One night, just at dusk, we saw one start on the edge of one of the mountains, and even while we watched we could see the orange flame spread and grow. The nearest telephone was at eight-mile cabin, a long way down. We ran. It was all downhill, and in not more than five or six minutes we were there and able to get the warden on the telephone. It took us much longer to climb back up, with big grins on our red faces. The warden had assured us that our forest fire was the rising full moon.
My diary is full of moans about the bad sketches I was making, but it later reports a quite successful exhibition of them and the canvases based on them. I am still learning that my paintings are always disasters while I am doing them. It isn't until I see them later, and someone else likes them, that I can see their virtues.
Bad news from home cut short our summer. Betty McCarthy died very suddenly of heart exhaustion in one of her recurrent attacks of asthma. Ken's letter made me decide to reroute my return trip through Toledo. He wanted to see me.
That was the year of the terrible epidemic of poliomyelitis in Ontario. The Toronto schools remained closed

until mid-September, and after I came back from Ken's, Curry and I had a rare opportunity to paint the autumn colours. We lived in one of Ron's summer cottages, on Hall's Lake in Haliburton, and painted and painted.
We paid for those weeks of freedom by a lengthened school day, "with school getting worse and worse every minute with an increase of time, and tightening of details and a growing sense of pressure. I am fed up. Except that along with it this year has come the new course of study which lets us try expressive illustration and for me marionettes! I'm having fun with them".

Tanamakoon did not give me the summer with Marjorie that I had imagined. True, we were both there, but not together. She was part of the group of beautiful, assured, senior councillors, all old friends from last year. I was a new assistant craft teacher, doing what I was told, directed by a woman who knew her basket-work and leather-craft, but was no artist. I was responsible for half a dozen fourteen-year-olds, with whom I sat at table, and whose cabin life I supervised.
"Tanamakoon, July 4. Chilluns all here, camp serene, me alone in bed, David patrolling, still a queer feeling that it's a purposeless sort of camp, and wondering what on earth is the soul of camp for them. For so long camp to me has been fellowship, intensely, with God and my friends, and then the joy of little intimate customs and occasions. Here my cabin assure me that they never talked about religion.
"Marge is hither and yon, and I'm busy with duties and confabs, and life is very full without visiting her, but I'm wondering if she'll come to say goodnight. Only three days of my teens left".
"July 5. With a horrible inferiority complex and a feeling of most complete uselessness - in the way if I'm with 12 (my cabin) and guilty if I'm enjoying life alone or with any other councillors. Haven't seen M today, except across the dining room. I love Dot Jackson. But this is no more camp!"

The news from home was disturbing. Dad's illness had been diagnosed as stomach ulcer, and I had left for the summer, confident that he was on the mend. But Mother wrote that "spinach and motoring are off Dad's list", and that alarmed me. Why should he not be adding foods and activities?
Camp improved with the weeks, or I began to appreciate it more. I still felt excluded from the inner circle of old councillors who surrounded Marjorie, but I found kindred souls on the fringe, and shared some memorable canoe trips with them on our precious "half days", when we were free to leave the camp after lunch, and to be out until after breakfast the next morning. That meant a chance to take a canoe across several portages into Canoe Lake, visit the Taylor Statten camps there, where Gordon Webber was art councillor, and sleep on the home side of the last portage, within reach of the deadline. Gordon was a friend from public school days, where he was notable for receiving more valentines than anyone else in the class. He lived on McLean Ave. and was part of that gang. He was one of the College of Art students who had pulled out when Mr. Lismer left, and gone with the Art Students' League. And recently he had come with his family to live in the big house to the north of us, and to drop in often for a yatter about our mutual world of art. We were friends on many different levels.

On one of the free half days, Margot, the Tanamakoon drama councillor, and I picked him up at Camp Ahmek, where he handled the art program, and carried him off for a shore supper on one of the islands on Canoe Lake. We talked late around our little fire, and when we came to paddle him back to his camp, a heavy evening mist had blotted out the edges of the lake. It was utterly still. We dropped our voices to listen to the silence, and as we felt our way through the mist, Gordon told us in hushed tones the story that was gaining credence in the park, that Tom Thomson, whose cairn on the hill we had passed that afternoon, had actually been murdered.
We let Gordon out at the dock, and he vanished into the night. We turned away and crept along close to the edge of the lake, swerving to avoid the deadheads that loomed at us out of the fog, poking into every little bay looking for the beginning of the portage. We were very quiet.
"The bay that had seemed to promise us a portage would end in a tangle of snags. We paddled hard, with a rhythm that made the canoe bounce on the water, but there was an eeriness in the night that rather affected me. The Canoe Lake portage was all right, by the light of the flash, and Smoke Lake came, big, beautiful, a little clearer. Again I felt the hostility of old deserted Nominigan, and shivered a little at the flashes of lightning and the thought of being forced to take shelter there. Margot asked me the time - just midnight. We nearly missed the portage, just

noticing the sign as we were preparing to leave the bay in despair.
"Never shall I forget the exhaustion of that dreadful portage. I felt that I couldn't bear it for another step - yet still we stumbled on to Koochie, and there I lay, numb with weariness, and the hopelessness of ever being able to move, I would try to sit up, and fall again on to our bedding rolls, knowing that Koochie was too marshy for a camping spot, but lacking energy to struggle on.
"Margot, fortunately, was a little less done out, so we crossed the pond, and were pulling the canoe out when we missed our pack. In again jumped Margot, and for a bad fifteen minutes we were separated, cut off completely by darkness and too sensitive to the stillness and mystery of the place to call to each other. I sat drunkenly on the moss, and tried to read the sounds, the knock of her paddle on the gunwale, the occasional drip or splash, pauses - while I imagined her in the channel - a long pause - again a knock - than a huge splash and silence. Had she fallen in?"
I wondered if I could get to her in my condition, and if perhaps cold water would revive me. "Margot", I quavered. "Margot, are you all right?" No answer, but at last the knock, knock again, and the canoe sliding towards me out of the darkness. "It was a beaver", said Margot. "It scared me too".
We left the canoe where it was. Margot carried the

"The painful joy of lying down, then in a minute, sleep. Morning came early, and we woke to see with interest the world we had camped in. Partridge-berry around us - a few 'ghost flowers' and such gladness in the sun, fears admitted and laughed at - and while Margot rolled the pack, I trotted across to Koochie, and almost danced back with the canoe. Gone the misgivings - gone the weariness - gone the ache from my shoulders!
"Breakfast was a gorgeous meal, which we ate with the sun on our bodies, rejoicing in vigour and strength, and the comradeship of the hour."
"Aug. 26 Mother says Dad is getting weaker and losing heart, a cold terror to hear. I can't bear to think of it. I won't believe it till I must. Poor Mother. This summer must have been hell for her".
Hell indeed. Mother had known before I went north that it was cancer, but she decided to let me have the summer free of that burden. And Dad was not to be told. Mother wanted to leave him hope.
We still had to live through the fall, watching him become paler and more frail. There was the day he taught me to change the washer on a tap, and my throat aching with the effort to keep back the tears and give no sign that I knew, and guessed that he

knew, why I had to learn to do it. Later there was the day that Mother had to bring home the papers from the safety deposit box, and have them all explained to her. And no words. I wouldn't have known what words to use, even if I had been allowed to speak. My diary is so tear-spotted that much of it is illegible. But at least I could write my grief.
Every day Mother helped Dad to dress, and he sat downstairs, not even reading, but rousing when someone called, and many did. The September night that Laurie and Dorothy were married, Mother and I went to the church, remembering how we had all been together for Doug's wedding less than a year ago. In Malvern days Laurie had been like another son around our place, and the boys had gone together into engineering. Later that night Laurie's mother came to the house, still in her gold lame finery, bringing Dad the bride's bouquet, with Dorothy's special love. Dr. Cotton dropped by often, casually, as a neighbour and a friend. We were all doggedly cheerful. I have often wondered if Dad would like to have talked with us about what we were all facing.
Mother had moved Dad into the big north bedroom with the sunroom off it. A day came in November when she couldn't rouse him, and his breathing was harsh. Mother called Mrs. Trowell, Grandmother's cousin, and she came down for moral support. I had taken over the small back bedroom as a studio, and I was slugging away at the Christmas cards that were my best hope of income that fall. About noon, Mrs. Trowell called Mother down to have some

lunch, and I took over the vigil. While I sat with my hand covering one of his poor white hands, he stopped breathing. That was all.
Having Dad "laid out" in the living room, formally dressed again, looking almost as he did in life, was an astonishing comfort. It gave us a chance to get used to the idea, and steel ourselves for the emptiness.
"Sat. Nov.15. For ages I wondered if I'd ever feel like writing again and doubted it, but perhaps it was having Dad's pen made me want to, to taste the joy of having it and to remember from years past the respect and almost awe that I held Dad's pen in, his care of it, and his care and method in keeping everything he valued. He's left us a heritage of dependability if only we were able to accept it....I'm so glad I went to the cemetery. It wasn't bad at all except for Jim's chatter (cousin by marriage). M was with me, and I watched the trees, bare branched against the pale sky - and wondered about the flowers - and told myself that it really wasn't Dad - and it didn't matter.
"Mother talks about how happy he must be with his old friends, and I can't feel anything except a fierce pride in him and in our love for each other, and a fierce resentment that my children won't know him or care. I can't bear to think that in another generation he will be forgotten, that the city hall people perhaps don't really care, even now, that his whole fine life will be forgotten even while the things he did are going on,

and I loved him so. One of my biggest comforts is that I didn't have to wait for him to go to discover how I loved him, and that for some unknown reason the tears stayed back and I could be calm."
Mother retreated into black widowhood, with a heavy crepe veil falling from her hat. It had some point. People knew enough not to ask her about her husband, and everyone was kind and considerate in shops and on the street car. After her long, faithful ordeal of nursing him, I didn't begrudge her the drama.
My concern now was to start to earn a living. We were a year into the Great Depression. Commercial art firms were laying off staff. I took my portfolio to Brigden's, nursery of so many of Canada's artists, and was told that I might work for them if I wanted, but they could not pay me. I decided to go on freelancing. The Saturday morning at the art gallery was a small but steady income. Moulton College, a private school for girls, gave me a little part-time teaching. Leadership of a CGIT group at one of the inner-city churches paid a small honorarium.
In the back of my diary I kept track of all my free-lance jobs, and what they brought in. That first year I made twenty-seven posters for various people and occasions, for as little as fifty cents, and as much as four dollars. I wrote and illuminated the oath of allegiance for the Ontario Boys Parliament, (fourteen dollars), and continued to do black and

white drawings for the United Church and CGIT. My biggest item was Christmas cards. I made and peddled hundreds of dozens of lino blocks of Haliburton winter scenes, printing and colouring them by hand, up to eight colours. One night Madeline and Edie and Barbara offered to help me make the matching envelopes, and I discovered once more that what seemed perfectly easy was difficult when you have never done it before. But we still got them made, and had a lot of fun in the doing.
In a different category in my mind were my sales of paintings, six oil sketches that first year, usually for ten dollars, which must have included frames.
Early in the new year Mother went in to hospital for what the doctors hoped would cure the misery she had been living with for too long. "Feb.12 Mother phoned just a little while ago to say that she was having another operation this afternoon, instead of coming home as she had hoped. This time they're cutting the muscle (of the rectum), so I'm a bit nervous about it. Poor Mum. If they should injure that muscle and still not effect a cure! The house is spotless. I cleaned it from top to bottom yesterday, and today I feel very let down to think that it must be done over again in a few days."

"March 5. I am writing less because I am thrilled than because today is a GREAT EVENT and I feel I owe a duty to posterity! One of my sick little canvases was hung in the OSA -'Morning Light', a view from Mother's window in the Private Pavilion (of the Toronto General Hospital). But after the first little kick, my pleasure is lost cause Curry didn't have one hung, and hers are so much better and for many reasons I wish it had been she. Poor kid - she's had so much to discourage her that I do wish she'd been lucky this time."
"March 7, 1931. Yesterday was immense! - a telegram first thing to announce Doug's baby - and the thought of them, with a little red baby - and them so thrilled with it, just made the day - ! - and then we were too excited to be coherent in a telegram, and finally sent one each, in our enthusiasm. The OSA opening at night was queer. I'm ashamed of my canvas, and many things made me rather miserable, but it was fun in its way, and I liked being with Kay (Byrne, a classmate)".
"Mar.11. A letter from Jessie from the north today - out of the blue, saying'congratulations'. Congratulations are the funniest things to me - I can't even realize what they're for. Today, reading Joseph Conrad's words about art, I realized for the first time that my miserable little canvas was, while I was working on it, genuinely sincere. I guess more thought and

labour went into it than usual, and I really did have an idea to express. But I expressed it so miserably!"
It was to be a few more years before I could go to an opening of a juried show, and see my work among all the others there with any satisfaction, I was overjoyed to be accepted, and sick with disappointment when the mail brought a rejection slip, but a juried exhibition is a stern test. In a one-man show the sum of the exhibition speaks more eloquently than any single work. In a juried show there is a babel of voices, all talking at once, the paintings often hung so close together that they compete for attention, and the one with the most strident voice is the one which is apt to be noticed.

	Miss Doris J. McCarthy
	Scarborough, Ontario


	Dear Miss McCarthy:

		Please accept my warmest congratulations on your being named a Member of the Order of Canada.

		You have added to the cultural strength of our country through several decades in the art 		community.

		You have served your country in so many ways; among them, founding instructor with Arthur Lismer's 	Children's classes at the Art Gallery of Toronto; full time teacher at Central Technical School; summer 		school teacher for the Ontario Department of Education; president of the Ontario Society of Artists; 		president of the Canadian Society of Painters in Water Colour. As well, you were elected an Associate of 		the Royal Canadian Academy.

		Colleagues have used the words "lively" and "going-concern" to describe you. I am told that you 		are a few courses away from earning a specialist degree in English. Frankly, you have much of which to be 		proud.

		Canada is a better country because of people such as you, and I am glad to offer you the best 		wishes of the Government of Canada.


		With kindest regards,
						
					
									Yours sincerely,



									Reg Stackhouse, M.P. 
									Scarborough West

de bienvenue dans cette association distinguee.

	In reflecting on the details of each citation, one is touched by the profound sense of personal vision that has brought each of these men and women to this moment. As varied as their careers and accomplishments might be, they are nonetheless united in their conviction to contribute and succeed, by their efforts to strive for and achieve a destiny far greater than personal satisfaction or material reward; and now, formally, by their association in this distinguished Order. These are the builders of nations; the human medium through which a country forges that chasm between its aspirations and their achievement, between its humanitarian ideals, and their realization.

	In the words of William Shakespeare, "some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them." The "greatness" we as a nation thrust upon these distinguished Canadians this evening is not a greatness of fame and glory, it carries with it no special privilege or monetary reward. Rather, it is a proud and heartfelt tribute of appreciation, a formal and well-deserved acknowledgement that will distinguish these

LA CHANCELLERIE
THE CHANCELLERY


										October 11, 1988


Dear Member:


	Enclosed is a recently-updated list of the members of the Order of Canada as wall as a copy of the speech delivered by the Governor General, Her Excellency the Right Honourable Jeanne Sauve, at the last Investiture.
	Over the past few months, our time has been spent defining our policy regarding communications and publications, creating the databases required to take full advantage of our new computer system and reorganizing and staffing new positions in the greatly-expanded Chancellery. Regarding the last development, I am pleased to announce a number of changes.
	First, the advent of the Canadian Heraldic Authority and the increasing emphasis on honours required changes in the structure and nomenclature of the Chancellery. Having long ago outstripped its name and being unequipped for the specialized expertise required in heraldry, the "Chancellery of Canadian Orders and Decorations" no longer exists. To incorporate the added responsibility for heraldry and raise the profile of honours in general, a Branch has been created, called simply "The Chancellery" and placed in the hands of an Assistant Secretary, Lieutenant-General Francois Richard, C.M.M., C.D., recently Canada's Military Representative to NATO. His Branch comprises two Directorates: Honours, which administers national Orders, Decorations, Medals and the Governor General's Academic Medal program and Heraldry, which has implemented a program concerning all matters related to arms, flags, badges and other heraldic emblems.
	The new Director of Heraldry and Chief Herald of Canada is Mr. Robert Watt, M.A., FHSC, who joins us from duties as Director of the Vancouver Municipal Museum. He will be assisted by two other officers, Mr. Auguste Vachon, M.A., FHSC, and Mr. Charles Maier, M.A.
	The Acting Director, Honours is Mr. W. David John, C.D., M.A., who is probably familiar to you as the former Deputy Director of the Chancellery.

	We would also like to inform you that the policy concerning the use of post-nominal letters has changed. All honours from the Queen of Canada will continue to be listed, but we will limit other post-nominals to those for the highest earned degree, one fellowship in a learned society and one professional qualification. A member's complete entitlement, of course, will be kept on record and used for formal, official correspondence. Any comments or corrections to your post-nominals used in this letter would be appreciated and we will attempt to accommodate everyone's preference within the above guidelines. Please note that the above-mentioned guidelines have been applied to the Membership List which we will send to you once a year.

	Of particular interest to members will be the news that recent developments in honours necessitate the revision of the Constitution of the Order. Major changes will include the deletion of the paragraphs enabling the honorary appointment of foreigners and the inclusion of a section permitting the augmentation of the personal arms of members who hold them. Questions frequently asked such as how to dispose of the insignia of the Order upon the death of a member and the new statutes will be covered in a document which will be published in the near future.


								Yours sincerely,




								Leopold H. Amyot
							Secretary General of the 
							     Order of Canada 
							    and Herald Chancellor

Uniforms						7



Male and female members of uniformed organizations, such as the Armed Forces, Police Forces, the St. John Ambulance Brigade or the Corps of Commissionaires, should wear their insignia as set out in their respective dress regulations.

Below are suggestions to guide those who wear decorations with military uniforms not subject to other regulations.



High-Neck Tunic

Those full-size insignia mounted on a medal bar should be worn attached to the tunic over the left breast pocket.

As many as three neck badges may be worn. The senior badge suspended from its ribbon is worn inside the collar of the tunic in such a way that the badge hangs outside with about one inch of the ribbon emerging from the opening of the collar. The second and third badges are worn with the ribbons emerging from the second and third buttonholes.

As many as four stars of orders may be worn on the left side of the tunic.


Open-Neck Tunic

Those full-size insignia mounted on a medal bar should be worn attached to the tunic over the left breast pocket.



							8

Two neck badges may be worn. The senior badge suspended from the full-width ribbon is worn under the collar of the shirt so that the badge rests on the tie immediately below the knot. The second badge is worn with its ribbon emerging from the top buttonhole.

As many as four stars of orders may be worn on the left side of the tunic.


Formal Evening Dress

When members of uniformed organizations wear formal military style evening dress (mess dress), they should wear their decorations in the same manner as for civilian evening dress (white tie).

When not wearing insignia with a military style uniform, it is customary to wear the ribbon alone. The "undress ribbon" is worn around a one-half inch wide strip of stiffening material and sewn immediately above the left breast pocket of the tunic. If more than one ribbon is worn, it should be worn without interval with the senior one closest to the centre of the chest.


Overcoats

Only those full-size insignia mounted on a medal bar may be worn on a civilian overcoat at outdoor functions. Neither neck badges nor stars of orders may be worn.


Lapel Badges

Included in the insignia of some orders and decorations is a lapel badge. This badge may be worn on the left lapel of the coat with any order of dress at any time when the full size or miniature insignia or the undress ribbons are not being worn. Women wear this badge in a similar position on the dress or jacket.

				ORDER OF CANADA — STATEMENT
				 A COMMUNITY OF DREAMS


	"The mind supplies the idea of a nation," mused Andre Malraux, the French philosopher. "But what gives this idea its sentimental force is a community of dreams."
	That image of Canada as "a community of dreams" is particularly relevant at this time in our history when the nation's continued existence seems threatened.
	Those of us fortunate enough to have been recognized by our peers and honoured by having received an Order of Canada feel duty-bound to speak out at this perilous moment. Without in any way endorsing the many and shifting political positions that are in play, we wish to reaffirm our faith and belief in this great country of ours.
	The Order's motto, after all, is "they desire a better country." We do — and we believe that a better country will emerge and can be perpetuated if every citizen rededicates him or herself to the ideals that allowed us originally to forge a nation across this huge chunk of geography.
	We may be a loose federation of wildly diverse regions, but there is a quiver of common intent that has held us together for 125 years — and will continue to do so, if we allow ourselves to seize the future that can and will be ours.

	It is my hope that we can generate enough interest and raise the necessary funds, to run this ad in The Globe and Le Devoir, at a time when the national debate on Canada's future might most benefit from such a declaration.
	Should you be willing to make a financial contribution, please send along a cheque payable to the Council for Canadian Unity, which will allow for tax deductibility.
	I do hope to hear from you.

P.S. Please write. There is no simpler or more direct way for you to endorse the feeling that you "desire a better country".

												RIDEAU HALL 												 		 OTTAWA


LE GOUVERNEUR GENERAL 
THE GOVERNOR GENERAL




											
											September 23, 1988


Dear Miss McCarthy:

As Chancellor of the Order of Canada, it has been my privilege to preside over nine Investitures. It is always with a deep sense of pride that I have the honour of recognizing Canadians who serve their country well.

This is a particularly exciting time for everyone associated with the Order of Canada. You may be aware that 1992 is the 25th anniversary of the Order, which was established on July 1st, 1967. We at Rideau Hall, as well as the members of the Advisory Council, will be involved in planning activities to ensure the success of the anniversary year of this distinguished honour.

To this end, I feel it is important that we work together to attract the attention of all Canadians, particularly the youth of our country, to help them discover the value of striving for excellence, of being the best they can be in their chosen field. We must collaborate to ensure that every Canadian recognizes the example set by lives characterized by courage and perseverance, by commitment and sharing.

I urge you, as an exemplary citizen of Canada and a leader in your field, to assist in this important task. I encourage you, as one of the builders of our nation, to be an "Ambassador of the Order of Canada", to wear your insignia proudly and to promote the importance of recognizing excellence.


Miss Doris Jean McCarthy, 
 C. M. , R C. A. 
  1 Meadowcliff Drive 
   Scarborough, Ontario

As a member of the Order, you are in a position to raise the profile of the Order in your professional association or group, your local media or your school board. If such opportunities do arise, we would be more than happy to provide you with information materials such as brochures or slides.

I welcome your ideas. I will listen to your suggestions and work with you in an endeavour to impel Canadians to remember. We must ensure that silence does not fall on the contributions of those whose pursuit of excellence has bestowed beauty and strength on our national spirit.



								Sincerely,



								Jean Sauve

      <dc:description>Letter from Doris McCarthy to M. Leopold H. Amyot, Secretary General of the Order of Canada, nominating Joy MacFadyan for membership in the Order of Canada
M. Leopold H. Amyot, 
Secretary General of the 
Order of Canada, 
Rideau Hall, 
Ottawa, K1A 0A1


	Dear M. Aymot,


	It is with great pleasure that I nominate Joy MacFadyen (Mrs, H. MacFadyen of 62 Rossander Drive, Scarborough, M1J 2B7) to membership in the Order of Canada.

	Mrs MacFadyen has, almost single-handedly, created in Scarborough a climate of participation in and support for the arts. In 1968 she sought out as many active visual artists as she could find in what was then the Borough of Scarborough and invited them to a meeting to consider forming an organization which could become for them a voice and an opportunity for interaction. From this modest beginning she has been able to develop an umbrella organization which involves all the arts, literary, musical, and dramatic as well as visual. The recent issues of the newspaper published by "Arts Scarborough", which I enclose with this letter, bear eloquent testimony to the variety and energy of the present membership.
	
	This has not been an easy achievement. Scarborough was an arid world when I moved here in 1940 . It deserved its contemptuous nick-name, "Scarberia". I have watched the change with appreciative amazement, and seen that Joy MacFadyen has been the catalyst. She would be the first to praise the many workers who have rallied to her. She is a modest, unassuming woman, a quiet but indefatigable worker. Already she is setting new goals. While her eyes are fixed on far horizons, her hands are busy with the details of the jobs that must be done to reach them.

	The Order of Canada is an appropriate way to honour such a person, and so demonstrate Canada's committment to a creative life for its citizens.

	Some of the people who have worked with her, and can witness to her worth are:

	Naomi Lightbourn, Community Arts Development Officer, 
	151 Bloor St. West, Suite 500, Toronto, M5S 1T6

	David Masters, at present treasurer of Arts Scarborough,
	long time worker in that organization,
	c/o Price Waterhouse, 1200 Markham Road, Scarborough,
	M1H 3C3

	Bruce Fleury, Commissioner of Parks and Recreation, City of Scarborough, 150 Borough Drive, Scarborough, 		M1P 4N7

Dear Doris:

Congratulations on receiving the "Order of Canada". With your assistance and in your honour your many friends raised three hundred and ten dollars which we have most gratefully received earlier this week from Betty Coleman.

As you know, we are sending 23 Grade 5/6 pupils to our Scarborough Visual Arts Camp east of Bancroft June 10 - 20. The monies you and your friends raised not only financially assisted all twenty-three young artists but in particular made it possible for "Matthew" to attend this Camp. This young man is one of our brightest pupils who, for financial reasons, might otherwise not have attended.

We are pleased to join you in promoting and furthering Visual Arts and thank you most sincerely for your kindness and this special consideration of Bendale Junior Public School.


Your friends, listed overleaf, join the staff and pupils of Bendale Junior Public School in this salute; again our thanks for your contribution to the Arts in Canada and here at this school.

Miss Doris McCarthy,								April 30th., 1987
1 Meadowcliff Drive, 
Scarborough, Ontario.


Dear Miss McCarthy:

	I would like to take this opportunity to extend to you my most sincere congratulations on your appointment as a Member of the Order of Canada.

	While being named to the Order of Canada does indeed recognize your achievements as a Canadian artist, I would submit that this honor is testimony to your lifelong commitment to pedagogics and to the students you have served during your most distinguished career as Teacher in the Visual Arts.

	Thank you for your note acknowledging my exhibition here at McGill. The works shown were a practical visual expression of the more discursive approach taken up in my M.A. Thesis Dissertation on the religious implications of Martin Heidegger's philosophy of art and aesthetics.

	Your comments on the liturgical aspects of your art interested me very much. I share your interest in what may be described as the religious component in the artistic ritual process inherent to the creation of the Work of Art.

	For some time now I have understood my own artistic producing process to be a type of religious activity analogous to sacred ritual. As a matter of record, after having obtained my B.A. in Art History, it was from this intuitive cognition that I chose to continue my Post-Graduate Studies in the Faculty of Religious Studies.

	Though not commited to any one specific religious orthodoxy I have undertaken a comprehensive study of the relationship between Religion and The Arts, more particularly those religious phenomena related to the Creative Process in Art.

	Of special interest is the Byzantine aesthetic in the Tao of Painting and the border territory between Religion, Art and Psychology being explored by the Jungian school of analytic psychology.

	Your painting, Iceberg Fantacy. that served as cover design for the Wynick/Tuck Gallery invitation, announcing your March, 1987, exhibition, is an especially fine example of what Rudolf Otto has described as those most fundamental elements of the Numinous or the Holy — the Mysterium and the Tremendum.

	This work also calls to mind the whole problematic of the metaphysics of light that would play such an important role in the Neoplatonic art of the Italian High Renaissance.

	All in all, then, I would like to thank you for giving me the opportunity to show that the visual artist indeed engages himself with the capacity for initiative in the world, every day — seeking always to preserve the mystery of the being which is entrusted to him.

	Please extend my warm regards to Miss.Virginia Luz.

	Best wishes for Good Health, Long Life and continued success.


							Respectfully yours,

HONOURS IN CONFIDENCE


								November 13th, 1987



Mrs. McCarthy:

	I acknowledge receipt of your letter dated October 25th, concerning the nomination of Mrs. Joy McFadyen for possible appointment to the Order of Canada. Thank you for drawing my attention to the correct spelling of her name.

	In answer to your query, we will contact the references you suggested and there is no need for you to do so. I should mention, also, that it is unnecessary to mount a write-in campaign for a nominee; the result might quite likely be the opposite of that anticipated.

	Because of the number of people involved in the nomination process and the high volume of submissions we receive, and given our limited resources, we find it difficult to inform nominators that their nominations have been successful or not. In addition, a non-appointment at the first review does not eliminate consideration at future sessions of the Advisory Council. Therefore, if you have not heard anything from the media about an appointment in two years, you may wish to contact us regarding the status of your submission.

	I trust this will be useful and appreciate your interest in this matter.


								Yours sincerely,



								Madeleine Proulx

Orders and Decorations, 
or Successor.



Dear Ms. Proulx,

	It is now close to two years since I nominated Mrs. Joy MacFadyen for possible appointment to the Order of Canada, and I am beginning to fear that my nomination has been forgotten.

	I should be sorry if you missed this outstanding woman by neglecting to make the enquiries which would confirm my estimate of her character and achievements. Mr. Gus Harris who was mayor of Scarborough during the most dramatic period of the development of Arts Scarborough, the umbrella organization which owes its existance to her vision, has retired from public life. He has been replaced by Mrs. Joyce Trimmer who was on council for several years and will be familiar with Mrs. MacFadyen's work.

	I am enclosing a copy of the latest number of the Arts Scarborough newspaper to allow you to judge from it the vitality and breadth of the movement that she initiated, and the amount of public and corporate participation which it is attracting.

	Her appointment to the Order would be acclaimed.


				Sincerely,




				Doris McCarthy, C.M. R.C.A., O.S.A.

	Dear Doris:

		I was so pleased, indeed delighted, to learn that you have been selected by Governor General 			Jeanne Sauve to become a member of the Order of Canada. On behalf of all members of the faculty, staff and 	your fellow students, I would like to extend to you our warmest congratulations.

		This must surely be the first time such an honour has been bestowed on one of our students. It is 		a most fitting recognition of your lengthy list of achievements as an outstanding Canadian artist and 			teacher, and to which I would add university scholarship winner.

		We at Scarborough College feel it would be appropriate to hold a reception in your honour, 			possibly some time in March or early April, and would like to invite friends both from within the College 		and your many other areas of interest and involvement. I have asked Doreen Marks to contact you in order 		to discuss the arrangements.

		Once again, our congratulations and best wishes. We are very proud to be able to count you as one 		of our students.



									Sincerely yours,




									G.R. Williams 
									Principal.

	Dear Ms. McCarthy,

	On behalf of our President, Mrs. Claudette Fortier, and the Board of Governors of the Canadian Conference 		of the Arts, I would like to congratulate you on your recent nomination to the Order of Canada.
	
	As you may know, the Canadian Conference of the Arts is a national association acting to promote the 		encouragement and advancement of arts and culture in Canada and to serve the interests of Canadian 		artists. Established in 19^5, the Conference's membership now includes a spectrum of over 1,200 		organizations and individuals in the field of the arts and the cultural industries.

	We are particularly pleased that this honour has been conferred on you because of your great contribution 		to the arts and culture in Canada. It is yet another encouraging sign of the increasing public awareness 		of the importance of the arts in our country. Your example, I am sure, will be followed by many others.
	

	With heartfelt congratulations, I remain, 
	
	Sincerely yours,



	Michelle d'Auray
	National Director

	Dear Doris -


	Our treasurer, Ron Clarke tells me that you sent in your membership fee for 1987. As a Life Member, you 		are exempt from annual dues. We will gladly refund the money if you wish, however, it occurred to me to 		ask you whether you might perhaps consider letting us put it into the Awards Fund for the Annual Open 		Juried Exhibitions? As you well know, the Merit Certificates and awards mean a great deal to the young 		artists, so we are always on the lookout for funds.


	I would like to add my personal congratulations on your recent Order of Canada award! We were really 		thrilled to read about it. And very proud to know you.
	





	Best regards,



		
	Ursula Matrosovs

	Acting Vice President

	Dear Miss McCarthy :

		Earlier this year, Government House received a request from a Companion of the Order of Canada, 		Mr. Peter C. Newman, for the addresses of all members of the Order so that he could advise them of an 		initiative he is undertaking within the context of the 125th anniversary of Confederation.
		As you may be aware, it is not our practise to release this information. However, following 		consultation with the Advisory Committee of the Order of Canada, it was agreed that Government House would 	forward directly to all members the attached material. Should you wish to pursue the matter further, I 		would ask you to contact Mr. Peter C. Newman, C. C. at the following address:


				Mr. Peter C. Newman, C.C. 
				2594 Panorama Drive 
				Deep Cove
				North Vancouver, British Columbia 
				V7G1V5


										Yours sincerely,

      <dc:description>Letter to Doris McCarthy from Dino Rigolo, letting her know they will be visiting Toronto, sent from Rome, Italy on November 11, 1965
Dear Doris – Just a quickie – I thought Mannuella had answered your letter and she thought  I had – until last night while she was washing socks and I was fixing the Hi-fi (isn’t that domestically in full?), and we discovered that neither ( of us had).
You sound just as busy as always- and your house must be even more enchanting with the lake or pond! I guess it freezes over during winter- is it possible to skate on it!?! This Monday morning it is cold for the first time. The temperature is 61 F. It has been raining lately- typical November in Rouse- but we really had summer like weather for the last two weeks. Most unusual!
We depart on Dec.16 arriving Toronto same day by air Canada 871 at 1905. I hope this will be chaotic trip than last time. Thinking over it, it seems like a nightmare. How we ever felt Italy without passport, I shall never know! This time, however, we all have our passports, injections etc. , and we are arriving under much happier circumstances. 
Marco Antonio is walking all on his own now, and that means we keep on the more 24 hours a day! I saw he gets into things I don’t know, but he manages the most impossible situations! His

best pass time is to get into the kitchen cupboard and play HAVOC with the sugar, spices, cans, boxes, bottles and so on. I’m sure the grandmothers will put up with it all, though! And what a busy time will have!
Of course, we will want to see you – anytime – You mention January 8 – just fine for us – but don’t fuss – we like intimate atmospheres!!
Come and see Marco Antonio – we’re dying to show him off!

		Yours sincerely

						Roma 29.5.63
Dear Doris,
I know I have owed you a letter for a long time – and today I woke up with the thought that I am going to chat with you for a page or two.
Well, I did it! I had a terrible automobile accident- and in the heart of Roma- all the crossroad of via Piemonte and via Sicilia! It is an area where there are very short streets, and STOP signs at every crossing. Well, I got bored after the first two, and just slowed down at the others. At via Sicilia. I “met” the other car coming from my right. I was wrong, wrong, wrong. I also had a chattering women beside me – in the ‘’death seat’ – and I was sort of concentrating on her conversation when a great white mass of American Ford Council station Wagon came ploughing into me; There was a woman at the wheel. I am pretty sure she was clipping along and hadn’t even seen me or the cross street – and I also think she was on the wrong side of the street. However, I was at fault no matter how you look at it. She (the Ford) carried grit
For almost two yards and literally folded my right side. Don’t ask me how, but not a scratch on anyone. The woman beside me (a cookery from London) at first gasped for breath, ( I frankly thought she had it), and then after what seemed an eternity. She opened her eyes; the door wrapped snugly around her hip and shoulder, and just carried on her conversation in an incessant

      <dc:description>Letter sent to Doris McCarthy, from Stanislao Dino Rigolo, regarding his car accident, sent from Rome, Italy on May 29, 1963.
jabbering! She was O.K! I was calm, took the particulars and got back in the car and drove off with it. There was not a rattle on her – and her guts were in perfect order. I took her he doorstep. A mess!
As a result of this accident, my plans for the tower will have to go much slower. Perhaps this year, I shall ‘’feel’’ it, and hope to get all my plans for it in order so that next year, (or perhaps this winter) I shall know exactly what I want to do with it. Meanwhile, I am lining furniture and restoring other pieces just for the tower.
31/C is just fine. Weekends, of course are meant at tarquinia. The weather is very lovely now, and I have a gorgeous, deep tan. Because of the hard winter, the Cherry season is a little late, and plants in general seem to be ‘’smaller’’ – they’ve never been through such beginning to bud. Such is life!
Do write if you have time. 
								Love,
									Stanislao Dino

Dear Doris McCarthy, 
Thank you for your letter which I recently received in my office. I was touched by your words of praise. 
I am pleased that you enjoyed my book and certainly appreciated your comments. The response it has received has for me been a source of great satisfaction. I am sure that, as an artist, you can truly understand the pleasure one feels at receiving accolades from friends, family and perfect strangers who want to share their thoughts. 
Again, thank you for taking the time to write to me.
										Yours  sincerely, 
										 Jean Chretien  
P.S Your paintings is the one that my adopted son who is from the north want to keep it, all the family loves it.
										Best Wishes
									
Jean  Chretien

been coming down here on Friday nights for the last six weeks to draw the pose in the nude. Good idea for me too. I did not give instructions, just got all the drawing I could for 15 ¢. Something has to be cut out though.
	Wish has taken on a contract with Buffalo and will be away every Saturday and Sunday. He has been away every since this first week - September. No wonder I appreciate that lad when I see him.

June 2, 1930
Dear Doris – 
Did you say that I could telegraph or perhaps telephone? Why the rush, little one? Or have I been doing a Rip Van Winkle stunt and the CNE upon us in a day or so. I know that I have been sleeping a lot but don’t rule it in.
So glad to have Doris thrilled over having a first important commission, and “I trust I shall carry out instructions to the best of my ability.” Ahem! 
When I first read over your – ah – plan, it gave me a vague feeling of something I have known before. Strange. Stranger still when you

hear of what it recommended me – playing bridge – a handful cards – such a handful you know – sort of drop a few getting them in order – then there they are one after the other – but “ bless my stars”  what do they all mean – 
You even ask me to estimate my time. I always do that every time I play bridge. That’s why I can’t keep intelligent count of how many spades every other fellow has and who hasn’t a heart and would fully well like one.  
Even if foolishness – that is to have a little ? - ? ride to anyone to-morrow.

How to estimate time? Dear one? At once – when in Toronto. I shall see Chris ?  but there shall probably be many a slip between the cup and the lip, the ? the cup and I’ll g? lip, and side of street can too and fro and wonder when time goes too. 
After ? Carpenter and I have done estimating paint, board etc it well probably be a day before I can “supervise erection of frame.” Now after I have done supervising and he framing will be pull out the bit of ? and the beautiful steps for me to my nice letterings?

Do you know the exact date when things must be in place before the opening? Probably the last minute before unless ? 7 lov? a more methodically than most. You can probably estimate the time much better than I knowing better what is to be done? I don’t want to go sooner than I have to but I’ll have plenty of time. 
Don’t swear (unnecessary profanity). If all this seems rather indefinite and I’ll be on the job. 
Weeks have gone by but I am only now getting into the swing of things. I feel almost uneasy in my bearings. My

											July 7th, 1949.
Dear Doris,
This is your birthday and I am remembering the joy and pain your happy arrival brought your dear father and myself. This occurs a long time ago - so much has happened since - well 39 years is a long time half a life time of a good long life. I thought of sending you a wire yesterday but refrained because I was afraid it might startle you and again not reaching Gaspe. I thought perhaps it might mean a messenger to you with the message and that is an added expense.  I tell you this so you will know

 I was thinking of you. I hope you are spending a very happy day. I had your card this morning written Monday night and you sound so happy in the Gaspe surroundings. I hope you have nice weather that will help to make your stay more enjoyable -
Our extreme bad weather broke yesterday and was I ever happy. I don’t think I could have stood it much longer. Its effects my breathing old bones cannot take it. There were several deaths among the aged from exhaustion.
	Everybody I know is away. Shirly left Monday last for Coopers Falls to be gone 2 weeks she has cousins there and they were coming to Toronto and wanted her to go home with them so off she went. Mrs M Lees is up at her cottage for a month. Then in August Beth and her husband and of course the babe have rented her cottage for August -
The Jenkings plan to get away Saturday for Dibgy N.S.  but as usual they did not make it. Some landslides on their property so they have to wait upon the someone Council – another delay - 
Ruth is getting impatient because she is tired and needs the rest. She admits it won’t be restful with her father along and would have preferred to have gone somewhere alone with her canoe. But as she says as long as she has her parents her own wishes must step aside for theirs and he is keen to go to Nova Scotia and the Sea.
Douglas only got the jeep Tuesday. He was disappointed but the garage man said you told him you were going away and would not need it so he put it to one side and it was only when they phoned to know when it would be ready that he woke up and made the repairs. Now that it is cooler

	Remember - news of C.TS. Lots of it. What problems are you having? Tell me you your marks – Has Donelly Parker a job? Tell us about stunt night when it comes. How is the roughly rugby this year? Do you hear news of us when in Haworth is Doris getting it better? And so on and so on and so on. We’re hungry for every detail.
	Your letter to send us off was perfect. We blessed you for it so many times. If you think it would have

 been fun to come and see us in N.Y.  Let me tell you lamb that ten days in the SS American farmer has N.Y. knocked into a cracked hit, so far as I’m concerned anyhow. In shear concentrated bliss let me recommend an ocean voyage. Its so lovely-beautiful-delightful that I can hardly bear to take my eyes off the ocean long enough to write this.
	Bar has the letter with the news for all of you. This is just a special little bills – and thank you dear

Dear Children,

I’ve stolen a few minutes exploring it too, especially the pictures but reading it has been seriously postponed until I can do it with a clear conscience.  We have to illustrate Somerset Maugham’s “Of Human Bondage” – 700 pages of it as

 our next school problem in illustration and I’m struggling to get it read once at least before the end of the holidays. “Salamanca” came looking very beautiful as you probably know if you saw it wrapped and Nory took the outer wrappings off so that I shouldn’t see any custom decorations on anything and it was put under the tree for Christmas morning. We had a dear little tree – about 2 feet high, growing in a pot and all covered with blue and silver decorations, and as well as that all the stockings were hanging over the mantel. We had a friend staying over with us overnight – the grand Rhode Island

girl whom we met on the American Farmer – and one more person made our little ceremonial of opening parcels that much gayer. Christmas day we went in the late morning to the mayor’s in Beaconsfield and had a most heavenly time there. the sort of fun that is only possible in a group of people who “click”. We played atmosphere and armchair murder and saving and heard the empire broadcast and ate an enormous amount and laughed and laughed. When we got home that night we were so in love with the day that we just couldn’t let it go and stayed up most of the

night reading Dickens’ Christmas carol in front of our own fire.
	Since then we’ve been tearing around at a great rate - seeing the wax works at Madam Toussauds. Where all the great of old times and modern times are so incredibly well done in wax that its hard to believe they aren’t real. There is a guard in the stair way and a bobby at the entrance who got asked questions all the time and it’s only because they don’t answer that you can conclude they are wax. 
I sent a couple of  cards from from there – Bad King John and good old Henry and the Ladies.

to the Tate gallery for the first time. They have the best collection in England. I believe we went nuts – trying to be all over it at once. It was thrilling to see things that were familiar though reproductions and equally thrilling to see stunning new ones by the familiar artists.
	We haven’t half finished there yet. There’s so much to see. And there has been a party every day or so – of some kind. The last three days I spent in Surrey near the Epson Racetrack with people I used to know in Canada. They are a young young English couple who used to live next door to us on Balsam Ave and

they have been great to all of us and especially to me – showing us bits that we might not have found for ourselves. This week I painted nursery rhymes on the walls of the room where the two small children sleep. It was fun doing it and in between spells of working we found time to take a bus to a little village near where they still have some of the charming old streets – left over from centuries back. We had tea in the “Old Spinning Wheel” – a 12th century barn with the original beams and windows and even the old wheel they used to use for winding up the bails of

 hay. Last night Nory and George came down and the Jillings had some other people in and we had a party, dancing and games and all the usual nonsense.
	It has been heavenly hearing from so many of you this Christmas that was a good letter Bar and I are most impressed by the card Betty Farrar achieved under Betty’s guidance. I think both sales were remarkably successful. You made more money on them than we have usually made in a whole years activities and they sounded life good fun too even if they were hard work. Here’s to Mrs Priestly!

 Mary’s long letter came just after Christmas. I’m terribly sorry about Muriel’s young sister. I hope she’s all better before this reaches you. When is the long-promised certificate of Nory’s aunt-ship. I’ve had rumours of it for months, but so far nothing more. She’s a good pal. I think she’ll be a very good aunt to you. I’m glad you had last council at the church. It must have been quite a pain getting them all in but its great that St. Aidan’s is taking an active part in district C.G. I.T.  too. Their presidents have quite a good record (and what presidents says I)

guess not. The most excitement yet! I’m so thrilled about it that I can hardly believe it’s true but anyhow here it is. I‘m going to Paris next weekend! PARIS! Whew!
	Kathleen Hitken who used to be at O.C.A. with me and who is very much of a darling is going with going with two other girls and they have invited me too. It’s to be a very cheap trip and all I’m hoping is that I won’t be ill in the Channel but ill or not. PARIS! I’ll tell you about it after it’s all over.
	In the meantime I hope you can read this

 I had so many cracks about one letter that I’m getting (finally) a little sensitive on the subject. Thank you darlings for the book and a very super New Year the best yet to you all.

      <dc:description>A letter from Doris McCarthy's maternal grandfather, Archie Moffatt, sent to her father George A. McCarthy regarding his second proposal to Doris' mother and his consent, sent from Montreal, June 18, 1900.
Monday June 18, 1900
Montreal
My dear Mr. McCarthy
	I have to apologize for my apparent neglect in not replying to your letter of the 10th more promptly but the question put is so serious that it must be my excuse for taking time to deliberate and consult – In my mind an engagement is as serious and binding as marriage and the interest of my daughter, for whom my love cannot be expressed in words, demands that it should not be lightly entered upon or without serious reflection.
	While I really appreciate the honor. you for a second time confer on me I regret you have not taken me more into your confidence respecting your worldly prospects for as I told you six months ago that was the only reason I had in hesitating to give my consent; for while I have the fullest confidence in your honor and good intentions. I know that young people are over sanguine and hopeful and consider the sentimental side of such a question rather than the material which I am sorry to say after all is the most enduring.
	However to relieve you from suspense, I give my consent, but I hope you will not misunderstand me. If I ask you to write me more fully on the above subject and to regard me always as your friend and wellwisher.

								AW Moffatt

My Sundial
New Year's Day 1922
Last night I had been reading "Just David" so when I woke up this morning I took up the story where I had left off the night before and read till Daddy and Mother awoke.  When I knew tney were awake I ran into their bedroom and wished them a Happy New Year.

New Year's morning we had toast made (--?) Mother's toaster and it was delicious.

It was at breakfast that I asked Daddy to get me my Sundial and he promised that he would.

After breakfast (we) I got so interested in my book that I surely would have read till dinner

had not mother reminded me that I was going to church.  It was so late then that I surely (deleted) would not have had time to change my dress hence I went to church in my pullover and shirt.

The sermon on forgetfullness of every-day incedents was so dry that I bussied myself with finding my favourite passages in the Bible.

Mr and Mrs Hacking were coming for dinner so I changed my dress and put in the time (f)? before our guests arrived with copying my "adventures of Dot and Dimple".  At last they came.  Mrs. Hacking is a dear.  She has light brown hair and wears it short and curly.  She had lovely manners and I know mother was pleased with her for afterwards she said "Mrs. Hacking is a nice, wellspoken little girl."

We had goose and apple-sauce and plum pudding for dinner.

Miss Putt was not at Sunday School so we had Catherine Harris for our teacher and the library was closed so I had to bring back my book.

When I got home I started my story about Fluff and wrote till supper was ready.

After supper Cousin Florrie dropped in for a little chat and they had quite a debate on the service of the Toronto Transportation Commission.  Daddy was the only one that was for it but he held his ground pretty well.

Jan. 1 1922
After Cousin Florrie went home I showed Mrs. Hacking Marjorie's and my book.  She thought Kenneth's drawings were very funny. Shortly after they left and I went to bed.

January 2nd 1922
In the morning I read and fooled around helping mother at intervals but after dinner I went skating to Kew Gardens with Douglas and Kenneth.  As the ice was cut up and very crowded and I had on my old skate, my ? new - being at Hopkins, I came home early.  In the evening we went down to the Allen and saw Tom Mix in The Ridin' Romeo.  We all agreed that it was great.

January 3rd 1922
In the morning Miss Baker the dressmaker came so I had to be fitted and it was not till after two O'clock that I met Marjorie for the first time since the Friday night I slept with her and went skating.  My skates worked fine.

Marjorie told me the plot of her story.  It was about a little girl, "Sunny of the Alley" she was called who was a little ray of sunshine wherever she went.  The other children of the alley loved her so that they made her Portly Pillar Princess, the Portly Pillar being a remnant of the alley's better days.  One time when she was rescuing a dog from being ill-used a limozine drove up and she recognised the lady occupant as the owner of a picture of her

"ideal" which she had cut from an old society paper.

The lady asked her the cause of the disturbance and the bully who had been hurting the dog manfully came forward and took the blame on himself.  The lady offered Sunny and her dog a ride home and on the way became so interested in the pitiable story of her every day life that she decided to offer some help.

After a lot of little incidents that lead up to the crisis it turns out that Sunny's mother and the kind lady are sisters and it turns out all right.  Sunny and her mother become rich and move to a delightful home in the country but Sunny's favourite spot is still her seat on the Portly Pillar.

While we talked and skated we promised eachother that we would dedicate our first successful attempts to eachother.  I told Marjorie about Orphan Gracie and Fluff and she told me about her Vanity of Peggy.  At last it was time for us to go home and we did, each greatly encouraged by the others enthusiasm.

January 4, 1922.  1st day of school.  To-day was mournfull in the true sense of the word.  I am going to leave out all the school part and just put in about how Daddy brought home my Sundial to me.  This evening I wrote in my Sundial trying to get it up to date again.  We went to the Allen and saw Tom Mix in a Ridin' Romeo. It was great

The sidewalks were so slippery this morning that it took me fully 25 minutes to get to school.  I was sure I would never get home and back in 40 minutes but I did for the sidewalks were nearly all covered with ashes or sand.  While I was home at noon I put on my square-necked jumper and my flowered under-waist.  I went to my music lesson and she was just as crabby as ever.  Nothing except that I went to the pond and Kew in hope of some skating and was dissapointed happened that was very exciting.

January 6th, 1922
I took my lunch to-day.  After school Marjorie came up and we went out for a walk.  Marjorie read me her "Vanity of Peggy" and I read my "Fluff" to her.  She like my "Fluff" better than anything else I ever had written.  That is, she liked my style.

The Irish Treaty has been approved for some days.  It gave the Irish Responsible Goverment like we have here in Canada at present.  I has not been signed yet, only approved by each party.

or as I thought asking me something.  I got so annoyed I yelled in the loudest stage whisper "yes". third Mr. Blakley said "The east coast of Australia is mountainous.  The range of mountains extend to the Island of Tasmania.  What therefore would you expect?"  He expected the answer to be "islands" but I had not been listening very intently and I said "A mountainous country".  Of course everyone laughed as they had the two other times. Then to be sarcastic Mr. Blakely said "You are getting to be a regular philosipher Miss McCarthy."  That was all that happened but that was enough.

To-night Daddy and I went to hear Jack Minor's talk on birds.  Jack Minor is a moderately old man.  He is partially (p?) bald and what hair he has is silver.  He told us how to tame robbins and wild ducks but spent most of his time on the Canadian goose.  He says he strongly resents any person calling a fellow person a silly old goose.  He says silly is the last thing in the world that a goose really is.  He gave us many examples of the remarkable intelligence of the birds and had slides and motion pictures to illustrate his lecture.  It was very very interesting.  Somehow or other I lost my fountain pen which I had very carelessly left in my overcoat pocket.

This afternoon I met Marjorie and had quite a talk with her.  She had shown

Maids of Malvern Meeting.  The meeting consisted of the minutes and all the things like that also!!! Song Contest.  Our form only having a few representitives gave no song but all others omitting 1E did.  The fifth form was the best but as it was for intercollegiate purposes the fourth form got the shield.  The club paper was read and after we all took out our chairs a dance developed.

Saturday Jan. 21
This afternoon at 2 O'clock I went down to the church and got into an awful mix-up about the play.  Miss Vatcher wanted to have it and mother had promised to give it to Miss Graham.  In the end it was decided that we would let Miss Graham do it.

      <dc:description>Doris McCarthy's personal journal from ages twelve to fourteen. Doris McCarthy started writing with Marjorie for the school newspaper.  Both of them developed an interest in authorship and deicded they would ask for diaries on Christmas 1921. Doris started her first journal, this one, on New Year's day, 1922. Because Doris' journal was blank, she could write whenever and however much she wanted to on the pages. Doris also developed the habit of drawing/sketching at the same time as here interest in writing. Although there are some sketches in the journals, she \primarily used other exercise books for drawing.
As soon as I arrived home Marjorie came up and called for me and together we went down to Miss Grahams and showed the play to her.  She thought it was very good and although I didn't catch any definite promise to put it on she mentioned drafting the parts and told us she thought the little children would act much sweeter.  "I have a little girl only four and a half years old acting" she said.  After we came out of there we went to the library and got books out.

February 3, 1922
Lots and lots of things have happened since I wrote in you last little Sundial.  Chief among them were 1. Last Sunday Marjorie and I finished copy my that parts of our play out and delivered them to Mrs. Graham.  The practise that was to be on Monday was called off I suppose because she was just going to distribute the parts that day.  All Wednesday night (I mean tuesday night and early Wednesday morning) I had a very bad ear ache.  Although nothing that could not stand it kept me from sleeping and it was dreadful waiting for mother.  When she came home she dropped oil in it and by a quarter after two or thereabouts I managed to doze off.  I didn't go to school the next day but Thursday I went.  I didn't take drill.  To-day I am staying home (expecting but by no means hoping) to take a dose of salts. booooo.  Sure enough my expectations were fullfilled and although

mother says I havn't half taken them the taste was there.  It was this way.  You see when I drank it there was a little left in the bottom.  Mother claims it was half but it wasn't.  Then after I had swallowed what was in my mouth I spit to get the (sl?) taste away and mother says I spit all I didn't throw out, away.

Sunday Feb. 5
I'm afraid "O' Gee" is going to be a failure.  Marjorie's things are so much more real and lively.  Yesterday I went out with her to Mrs. MacWater's.  She was getting fitted.  She is in a quandry as to what to have for a mystery and also thinks things are going too much for "Marie Eleanor".  She thinks M.E. ought to have more trouble at first.  Maybe she should.  I can't seem to

get any decent ideas for "Orphan Gracie".  I don't know what to have happen at the haunted house or at the picnic.  I have finished the fire, new teacher, and revolution and am just up to where the lawyer is going to arrive on Christmas day.  In a while Fluff will be finished but Dot and Dimple is dry as pancakes.  I am just writing the part about their visit to the moon.

Wednesday Feb 9 1922
This afternoon I went to skating the pond with Marjorie.  We played Ruffian Bill and had great fun but the ice was desperately cut up in most places.

To-night (we) I went skating with Bobs(?) on Hannahs rink.  It was perfy(?).  Doug Hannah is a wonderful

Thursday Feb 10 1922
I went skating again to-day at Hannah's.  The rink was sticky but there were lots there and we played "tag" and "May I" for quite a while.  I played "dibs" with Fred, his lip allowing him to come out though still very swollen, and he fleeced me of my lead ones and Helen gave me her six and he won those two.  Never mind what the diff.  I hav'nt done a spec more on Dot or Dimp, Fluff or O. Gee, therefore am very much ashamed of myself.

This afternoon I went down to Williamson to call for Marjorie.  She had to go out to her Grand-mothers so I went out with her.  She had a perfy(?) idea for Marie Eleanor.  It was about a library and her future father.  She meets him at the library and has quite a talk with him but they do not recognize each other because M.E. has a bandage over her face.  The coppies of the play arrived to-day.  They are peachy.

Thursday Feb 16 1922
To-day was the Valentine Social.  Hurrah!

I had to go to my "petit" likewise darn Music Lesson.  So I came in late.  They had given out little red hearts with names like Ivenhoe and Rowena, Jiggs and Maggie, Mary Pickford

and Douglas Fairbanks.
It was by means of the names that you found your party.  There had also been a screamishly funny(?) version of Romeo and Juliet given and I missed it too.  I had two dances and I have resolved to learn to dance before the next meeting.  I was there for the Lucky Number Dance.  Muriel Robinson and Evylen Cross won it in other words two dear little ? cupids.  After a while they threw balloons around and it was great fun busting them.  They served pink ice-cream and biscuits and after a little while I went home.

Before I went.  A big girl and her sister little Joyce of the red cheeks danced.  Irene(?) Johnson or the girl I was wont sit beside at Botany gave a violin solo and Yvonne recited "Ojestoh" and "Tit for Tat"

Thursday I took my last lesson from Miss Chalmers!  Hurrah!!  Not that I dislike her very much but I don't like her at all.

Yesterday I went to the Allen to see the Kew Beach, Williamson Rd and Pine Avenue concert.  W.R.S.'s boy's choir was the best number.  Last night I slept at Marjories' place.  Edith ? was there and I showed the two last mentioned and Eleanor how to make your arm rise involuntarily by the pressing of your arm for 15 seconds against the wall.  After reading for a while we went to bed getting asleep about 11 O'clock.  We woke up often being in the little room whose window you have to pass through to get to the outside sleeping porch.  In the morning Marjorie read me the V. of P.  It was

Just think little book today is Princess Mary's wedding day.  It gives me thrills just think of it.  Over here in Canada and in Toronto it is bright clear and oh this day does seem almost sacred in its beauty.  By means of wireless you will be able to hear the Wedding Music 500 miles out at sea.  There was a picture of her gown worn by another girl in last nights paper.  It is marvellous. All cobwebby silky something overskirt and a marvellous satin gown.  Jack Biddle (f) left saturday.  He has promised to bring me a leaf or something actually from Westminister Abbey where Princess Mary is to be married.  Queen Mary is to waken her daughter with a kiss for it is a Royal tradition that every Princess should on her Wedding Day speak first to the Queen her mother.  The United States only sent her one gift.  It was a candleabra from the New York Police Reserves.  They are mostly Irish but isn't it queer that a police force should send her a present?  She is to be at the Abbey at 11 O'clock.  There is one girl only 14 years of age to be her bridesmaid.  Isn't it wonderful?  She must by so excited she can hardly speak.  I am putting a lot of clippings in you for safe keeping.  Pictures and accounts.  The 14 year old girl is Lady Diana Bridgman an is my social ideal.  (Miss Ra - deleted)) Lady Rachel Cavendish is Marjorie's.

Dear little book  I HAVE FINISHED ORPHAN GRACIE!  Enough said of course I have to go all over it correcting changing and modifying but I have finished every incident.  This is about my most sacred day.  I wonder if it will be acceptable at all.  Oh their are so many things that I wonder.  Will they ever be satisfied.  I thought of something more I had to write just this minute what was it?

Wednesday March 8
I have won the oratorical contest!!!!!!  It was this afternoon and I inclose pin that pinned my sheets of composition together.  I wore my white silk waist under my school jumper and I know I look nice.  I thought I take cotiption fits when Mr. Rogers read my name out.  He took an awful long time deciding though and spoke a lot before anouncing it.  Mr. Blake was a !!judge!!  Miss Simons and Mr. Rogers were too.  Afterwards Miss Simons came up to me and said "Let me congratulate you Miss McCarthy."  I thought I'd faint and I don't see how I ever managed to say "Thank you."  I scurried away as quickly a possible but I bet Babs was glad for she had told me she would chew her hat if I didn't get the prize.  I was terribly nervous but it was worth it cause mother is going to give me lobsters for lunch to-morrow.  We had a French exam yesterday and I think I did pretty well.  Dorothy Bassman says I got 92% (82%?)in Comp but I'm not sure.
P.S. I got 45 in Comp - Mr. B was not (double underlined) a judge.

March 18
To-day is my day of days.  It is Saturday March 18 but much more important it is the day of my "first" Shakespeare Play.
But let me begin at the beginning.  I met Marjorie at 1 O'clock at the bottom of Balsam as arranged.  There was a blockade in the cars so we walked to the first one and inquired how long it would be.  We received the none too satisfactory answer of 2 hours.  Just then a little ford coup� drove up and the conductor asked the man if he would give us a lift.  The car was crowded so we didn't get in at it.  Then a beeauutifuul Hudson limosine drove up with only two men in the front and in we hopped having palpitations of the heart the while.

When we got fairly under way however this left us and it realy was lovely riding in the beautiful easy silent ? prettily lined limosine.  The two men in the front talked taxes and said not a word to us except to ask where we wished to be put off.  He left us at the corner of Queen and Sherbourne telling us to take a Belt-line car.

We arrived at the Royal Aleck in fine time and read a little of the Girl of the Limberlost before the curtain rose.
The play is a never-to-be-forgotten one.

Charaters

Duke of Venice - Mr. Frank Peters.  He centred chiefly in the court scene but was not by any means important.

Prince of Morocco - He was a scream.  He was a darkie and

a suitor to Portia's hand.  His acting was splendid.

Prince of Arragon - He was the most conceited idiot that anyone has ever seen.  He chose the silver casket labled "He who choseth me shall have what he deserveth."  He was splendid with his monacle.

Antonio - Antonio gave me the thrills.  He was splendid and as realistic as possible.

Bassanio - He was lovely.  I think the way he chose was the thrillingest thing.

Salarino - I don't know just who were they but everyone was good so they were too.
Salanio

Gratiano - He was excellent.  I noticed that all them were very light on their feet and he particularly so.

Lorenzo - he was dear and he woed and won Jessica darling.

Shylock - No words can express him.  He was marvelous.  You just wanted to cry when he broke down at the end and wept on Tubal's shoulder farther in.  He was the (double underlined) character and I shall very forget him.

Tubal - He was very good too but his was not an important part.

Lancelot Gobo - He was the funniest thing, a little fat boy and so utterly

different than his father old Gobo who was blind lame and the most pathetic thing.

Portia - She was wonderful.  Very pretty she looked too though through opera glasses she wasn't extra.  He acting was wonderful.

Nerissa - She was very good too but could not be called pretty.

These are the principal characters.  Oh I'll never never forget the wonderful details of the plan.  It was so real.  Afterwards I met the Jenkins Beth Bunny Mrs. And Mr. Mr. Jenkins called me Hiawatha instead of Owyasenego(?).  I had quite a talk with Beth and introduced her to Marjorie we parted outside and Marjorie and I decided to walk a little way.  We went into a soda fountain and had chocolate walnut sundaes.  Marjorie's treat, then after a short walk we decided to take a car.  We stopped at a corner to wait but the car stopped behind so we ran to catch it.  We were just to late so we went back to the side-walk whereupon they opened the door again and once more we were just too late.  well we decided to walk another block when a nice I don't know what kind of a car came and stopped and the man inside asked us if we wouldn't like a ride.  Maybe we refused.  Again maybe we didn't.  He was awfully nice.  Betty Lallar's(?) father mind you.  B.L. is my big sister you know

He was awfully nice and jokey and stopped at Balsam for me and at Spruce for Marjorie.  His number I took care to notice was 97-831.  So came the "end of a perfect day".  I shall enclose my seat cheque and program.

Marjorie won the oratorical prize last Monday.  Her speech was perfectly wonderful.  I was so glad she had.  Her picture was in the paper so I enclose it and an account of the affair.  She wore her little blue tricotine dress.  Last night there was a picture of our memorial monument in the paper so I enclose it too.

The play is not necessarily going to be on May the 10th but somewhere near it.

Marjorie give me a very pretty Easter egg.  It has white icing around the joint and a very sweet white dove and lily of the valley on the top.  We went for a ride yesterday but we are no farther on in our house.  I didn't go to Hoods after all for Bobs phoned me to say that Dorothy B. couldn't come.  I don't believe I have in that Sir John Eaton died. Well he did on Friday, Apr the 7th.  Mrs. Begg down the street died on Easter Sunday.  She leaves 5 orphan children.  Mrs Turner of Spruce Hill died on Easter Sunday too.  Marjorie Whitelaw's mother died ditto.

Saturday April 22
On May 1st the Play is going to be.  I saw a rehearsal the other day (day before yesterday) and was much impressed.  I have got money for 24 tickets and have sold 53 and have orders for 15 besides a lot of people to "phone."  Mother and Mrs. Beer are paying for the program.  I went down to the York Chapter Meeting on Thursday.  Marjorie gave her speech.  It was lots of fun hearing a real meeting and I enjoyed it.

May-day - play day
I enclose programme, ticket and Sunday's leaflet.
I awoke this morning with a funny feeling that something was going to happen.  Then I remembered - the Play - I lay in bed a while, shivering with excitement but finally

getting calmer I got up.

Mr. Blakely took the nominations and votes for the ID Girls Baseball team.  Barbara (Hood) got 15 votes, Dorothy Bassman 2 and Evylen Cross - 3.

We had a practise after school with 1B and had great fun.  After playing till four o'clock I went down to Hoods and practised jumping for the field Day (May ?).  It was twenty minutes after six when I got home.  Mother showed me the flowers she had got for Mrs. Graham.  They were pink carnations and beautiful.  Then I had supper and went upstairs to dress.  At about 7.05 O'clock I was at Beer's for Marjorie.  She had gone to deliver some tickets so I went to Whitehams (?) to wait.  Marjorie
called for me shortly after and we went to the church.  Daddy was the only one there at first but the hall filled rapidly and before we knew it we were having trouble in saving seats.  Miss Baskervill's friend Miss Brown sat beside Marjorie and I.  Mrs. MacWaters and Waters behind us and Mr. MacWaters and Miss Baskervill behind them.  Marjorie and Jim and the Andersons (Including Jimmy and Drewy) sat there too.  Olive Westerman is fourteen.  Next year she is going to drop school and take up music.  Now she practices 3 hours a day and stand 5 &amp; 6(?) in class.  She played beautifully.  The dear darling little page played too and was sweet.  Reta Stone's recitations were splendid and mostly pathetic

Madeline's was very good too.  Now we come to the play (double underline).  It all went beautifully except the king (Irene Milton).  She carried the plot of the story but spoke so indistinctly that no one heard her.  After it was over Doctor Cotton brought Mrs. Graham out onto the stage, and Mrs. McKann and Margaret (?) and a whole gang of dear little fairies came in and gave them flowers then they went out.

Then (double underline) Dr. Cotton asked us to come up and the sweet darling little page came out and the funny little princess came out and (double underline) gave us each a big basket of pink sweet peas and heather with a blue gauze bow and card with ----- ----- find it enclosed.

May 1
We were so overwhelmed we didn't know what to say but we (sayed) said something - what - will never be known.  Everyone was so pleased and proud and happy.  It was certainly a wonderful evening.  Sir Peter and Lady Teazel were excellent too.  Miss Pratt (?) , Mrs. Trowell (?), Bobs, Roy Van - Mrs. Barber, the (Photographer) Kennedys, the Club, Miss Baskervill both families and sundry other people all were there.  After it all was over we got some tickets and programmes as souvenirs.  Mr. Anderson, who had taken Mrs. and the children home sooner met us out-side the door an drove us home.  This day is an epoch in my life.

The play was given again at a meeting of the Smith-? Chapter on Thursday.  Marjorie was the king.  The first thing Princess said was (in a huge stage whisper) "Did you bring your bike" for on Wednesday at a rehearsal she had got on my bike and ridden quite a ways.  She's five and had never been on a bicycle before.  Marjorie's costume looked fine and her part went splendidly.  We were introduced to Mrs. Graham Thompson.  She said she thought it was very clever.  The Globe Mail and Empire (which I enclose) and Telegram (small one) had write-up about it and maybe the Standard too.  The little page played again but was no more friendly.  I got well acquainted with Margaret Heath (?) and she's awfully nice.  We (M. &amp; I and D.r (?) Beer and Harry and Graham Kerr) went up to the Ex to-day to see the races. Willy Sheran was the only familiar figure and he came in fourth in his race.  We had 2 bags of peanuts (between M. &amp; I) and an ice cream cone each on the way home also Marjorie bought a Laura Secord chocolate bar (yum yum) giving me half.  I ate it after supper and it was deeeelicious.  Jack got home Tuesday.  He brought me 4 Swiss coins 3 french a shamrock broach from Ireland.  A LEAF FROM THE VERDUN WREATH FROM THE UNKNOWN SOLDIER'S GRAVE and a LEAF FROM THE IVY ON NOTRE DAME CATHEDERAL PARIS. Just think one from Westminister abbey And one from Paris.  I am deelighted.  He's head over heels in love

He�s daft over her.

Saturday May 20
Yesterday was the unveiling of the Statue.

They had a balcony built behind it for the Guests of Honour.  This was all draped in flags and red-white-and-blue bunting.  The cadets were in front of the statue and the girls on the sidewalk behind it.  We all wore white middies and dark skirts but it was so cold that we had to wear coats over them.

The ceremony was very impressive and solemn.  Mr. Letham was a scream he wore his college gown and looked just like a big fat pompose proffessor.  His gown flapped and blew like anything.

Dr. Beer was there and made a speach but we didn�t hear it.  We couldn�t hear anything and near froze to death till Mr. Lichman (?) came and told us we could go in if we were cold but we didn�t want to miss anything so we immediately became warm.  After it was over I introduced mother to some of the teachers but I couldn�t find Mr. Blakely anywhere.  Last night I went over to Mrs Graham�s demonstration.  Francis dances very nicely.  Princess was over there looking as dear and sweet as possible.  Maudie Mitchel Played too.  She is perfectly darling but so unfriendly and I am afraid � spoiled.

Last Monday I got Rainbow Valley out of the Library.  I just adore its ending.  When I had finished I just didn�t move

for almost two minutes I felt spell-bound.  It is darling but Marjorie likes Rilla of Ingleside even better � It must be wonderful.

Daddy is going to enamell my bookcase to-night.  He has already given it two coats of white paint.  I have just finished reading The Little Colonel�s Knight comes riding (?).  Its perfectly sweet.  I love Lloyd.  Poor Betty.  Her dissapointment  at her returned manuscript makes me want to cry.  It is so touching.

We have had Comp, French, Algebra, Bookkeeping and Literature in the order named but the worst is yet to come.  I haven�t copied any of O.G. for ages.  I�m getting dreadfully lazy.

The Choir go to Brampton to-day.  Marjorie was all excited over it.  An announcement was made in school today that a lady � I forget her name was offering a $50 prize for the best essay by a person under 16 on the Battle of Jutland.  I may try.  The exams were fierce

Yesterday I went and saw May Blacks Wedding.  It was wonderful.  St. Pauls impressed me greatly and especialy the beauty of the stained glass windows that Brig. Gen. Charlie Michael brought from the ruins of the Catheral at Rheims.

The chancel was decorated with flowers in a V shaped.  The back-ground was of palms and ferns (?) edged with pots of pink � a salmon pink, - gladiola and bridal wreath.

At intervals in about the centre of each side and running paralell to the aisle were huge stands of furns with some kind of vine, strung between I enclose a tiny sprig of it.

The music began shortly after we arrived.  It was sweet and solemn.  Then lots and lots of guests arrived all dressed so sumtiously (?) and in the very latest style.  By and by a sweet resinous (?) note sounded.  Just like a trumpet and the 

wedding march began.  Then the bridesmaids came.  They wore a goblin blue but pale canton crepe dress.  It was cut simply round the neck an fell strait but was caught in at the waist with some French organdy flowers their right sleeve was a cape something (sketch) like that. I can draw it.  They had hats of the same material and traines with orchids.  There were three of them each carrying a pretty silver vanity case on her arm.  The little flower girl was darling too.  Dressed in stiff white organdy with a fluffy frilly little bonnet

of the same.  The Bride!  Words fail to describe her.  She just thrilled me and oh I�ll never forget the way she look.  She kept her gaze on the floor didn�t look up.  She had a tulle veil over her face which served to soften the effect.  Her boquet was of orchids lilly o� the valley and sweetheart Roses.  Her train was ten feet long and her tulle veil fell to the end of it.

Her father had her on his arm.  At the end of the isle he stood with her for a while then gave her to Hugh (?).
I was dissappointed in the fact that I could not hear the ceremony for the minister spoke 

very low and May and Hugh even lower.  The most thrilling part (almost) was when they knelt down and he put the ring on her finger.  But the most thrilling was when he pushed back the veil from her face and kissed her.  That just thrilled me.  Immediately after they went out to sign the register.
	
When the Bridal Procession came up the aisle again I got a better look at May.  She was looking all over now and laughing and talking � seemed very happy.  The flower girl looked at me and smiled.  This is my Bicycles Birthday too.  This evening Jack &amp; I and Margaret &amp; Mr &amp; Mrs went for a long ride in the car and didn�t get home till late.

Thursday June 8
Today Mother and the Club and I went for a picinic over to the island.

Captain Trowel (?) called for us and drove up to the depot.

We had barely got inside the shed when the most terrific cyclone huricane thunderstorm downpour and tornado came up.  It blew everything to bits and the dust inside that slated sheds!  Good-night.  A sign was blown down and (?) from the magazine stand and it kept the rest of the party from ariving until later.  Therefore we missed our boat.  We got on the next and the sun shone all the rest of the time.  The storm had served only to clear the air and make it

cooler without even wetting the grass.  I was disappointed for not having sense enough to bring a ball but Mr. West a nice, gray haired, old man, bought me a big black india rubber on one and a yellow (?) bat.  I played ball most of the time and had great fun.  Mrs.         spilt tea on her dress and we had a few more screamish accidents.  We went home about 1/2 past 8 and Trowel rode us home again.
That was the 2nd night I had been up late in one week.  With an exam coming to-morrow too.

Friday June 10
Frances� party took place to-day also a Geography and Art Exam.  About 1/2 past 5 I went accross the street and then all but Evylen Hill had come.  She came after a while and we all went in for supper.  The supper was lovely.  After supper Lillian Latimer went for a walk hurting Frances dreadfully.  She took Jean Cranston with her but I think it was mostly Lillians fault.  Those two were continually doing unnice things and Frances spoke in rather plain language for a hostess to a guest to Lillian.  A thunderstorm came up later and we all had to go home.  I whispered that I was sorry about what had happened

to Frances but she just said, �Never mind.  Its all right.  They�ve said they were sorry�.  On the whole we had lots of fund.

Saturday June 11
I phoned Marjorie today to ask her to go for a ride but Marjorie said no and asked me to go down and help her amuse three little girls that were coming from uptown.  I readily agreed.  We had a nice little talk before they came and after we went to Scarborough Beach.  We went on the Laughing Gallery Shoots, Old Mill, Merrygoround and Little Train all at Mrs. Howards expense.  Marjorie got some popcorn and stuff coming home.

After we got home we (M. &amp; I) chased around getting some things for supper

We had a nice drive to the station where Marjorie took a picture of us all cluttered up with boxes, grips, trunks coats, ect.  Mrs Ferrier was down at the station to see him off and he introduced us to the (?) his son who was going up with us.  Marjorie and I are crazy over him and his voice.  The journey up was mostly uneventful but very enjoyable.  Marjorie and I wrote silly notes to the Person who picks this up and threw them out the window.  Although later on it was rather dry and

extremely dusty the trip did not seem long and we were soon at the station.  Mortimer met us and soon we were in sight of the Island.  A large pine tree plainly stood out above all the other foliage and Marjorie and I christened it the spy glass.  As we rounded the point we came into the most tranquil bay.  It was lovely.  As soon as our trunks came Marjorie and I got into our bathing suits and were in swimming.  The cottage is dear I love it.  We have named it The House of Happiness and our room the Blue Birds Nest.

July 20
Lots and lots of things have happened.  We are all settled now.  There is the sweetest island accross from us.  Dumbarton its name is but we call it Our Isle of Sunshine.

We have made up a song about it and a Poem, a real poem about a soldiers version of his parting and object.  It is called A Solder's Quest.

The Richardsons who own Dunbarton are up with Miss Harryman a Junior in college.

We went to Church last Sunday.  Mr. Crossly, Crossly and Hunter, the Evangelists, preached.  Mr. Hunter is dead and whenever Mr. Crossly spoke of him he referred to him as Mr. Hunter, My Beloved.  Mr. C. is a dear old man with a young face in spite of the fact that his hair is white.  His front of his head is bald but he has white fluffy hair and is dear.  He preached a dear sermon.  More of a talk than anything

else.

Marjorie and I have not done much on our books but with resolutions for the future "put it off".

I got 2 books for my birthday, a wonderfull Ivory mirror (given to me before we left to prevent it being broken), a lovely blue Bird nightgown to match our room (Marjorie has one too, she gave it to me) and a photograph of herself.  A box of candies too so I was very lucky.  About the third day we were here Doctor Ferrier took us to Bala.  We saw Mary who gave us an orange and a piece of her lovely raisin pie each.  Marjorie and I have fallen in love with the Doctor.

Eric has developed from a nice quiet gentlemanly little chap into the most boisterous crazy tease.  Yes, yes, of course, In other words," says he every minute of the day.

He is awfully funny Marjorie and I have made the acquaintance of Ruth MacKay.  She is an awful nuisance.  I have given her more than one hint but she's awfully slow at taking them.  I don't like her much.  She's such a bore.

We have killed a flying squirrel and burried it - ouch -  Marjorie and I have established a Post Office, Castle Moss, Post Office.  It is a Laura Secord Box in a hole in the loveliest moss covered stump.   We drop notes in it from caracters, Killing Girls, Petty &amp; Peggy, Polly &amp; Peter and ?.  The Bathing is wonderful.  I can swim 6 times the width of the distance between the 2 wharves without touching once.  I have done it 2 ?  I am learning to dive.

Jim and Marjorie have been visiting us.  We enjoyed

Marjorie very much but mother is disgusted with Jim.  He didn't do hardly any wood but played solitaire all the time.  They are gone now.

Marjorie and I (and big Marjorie) gave mother a birthday treat.  I told her not to do any work but that was impossible so we contented ourselves with doing as much as we could before she got to it.  We gave her a Birthday Supper.  Marjorie and I made sovenir birth bark canoes, and I made menu cards.  Mother was very pleased and we had lots of fun.

Marjorie, Jim, Marjorie, and I took the round trip of the three lakes.  I enclose account written on board.

Friday July 28
The Richardsons and Miss Harriman came over last night and asked to take us out for a ride

but the "Shrimp" proved stuffy and would not start so they came to-day instead.  Marjorie, Harold and I were asked.  We went up to Beaumaris where we made some purchases then down to Cedar Wild.  We met Richard and Elvin Lush there.  As it was too rough to start we decided to wait till after it calmed down so we took dinner there.  Elvin afterwards piloted us up to Huckleberry Hill and Rock of the Winds.  There was the most wonderful view though the gale nearly blew you off your feet.  When we came down we girls? walked to Milford Bay where the Dr. met us in the boat.  As we neared the Millionaire Mellon's Island the rudder rope got caught and we went in there to fix it.  They have the most wonderful boat house and dear little dogs.

Pat and Mike.  After we left there we got out into rough water and so great was the spray that we turned back to the millionaire's dock again. The proprietor was out fishing but the maid requested us to make ourselves at home.  The Island was covered with paths, walks bordered by birgh logs.  It was very pretty but - there was the most wonderful speed launch mahogany - It was beautiful, would carry 20 people without the least crowding.  It was named the Carryall.  We were all in love with it and out exclamations would have been pleasing I'm sure if they had fallen on the Madam's ears.  We took a walk around the island and I got some grass which I braided.  I have since lost it.  We soon came down to the dock again and shortly after Mr. 

Mellon whom I since learned was the nephew of the minister of finance of U.S.A., came in his fishing (mahogany) speed launch the Kumango (?).  He had a catch of 18 huge bass some of which he directed the maid to take to some friends.  He is the typical millionaire a fat round big red nose, double chin, portly manner, and coloured glasses (also fat).  He ordered his chaufeur to bring us home in his Kumango.  We were overwhelmed.  I'll never, never forget that ride.  It was wonderful.  I since learned that he has 3 more boats, the Regal? and Sokemall? and the Lorimer? that Dorothy Bassman says is a houseboat.  It passed down the River in front of their house and

and they snapped it.  Dorothy is going to show me the snap.

When Marjorie and Jim were here we went the lake trip also afterwards when the Kettles Ass. organized a trip we went.  I enclose tags for it.  The KSRA also had a regatta at which they announced a contest in "Yells".  Best one got 5 dollars.  May and I entered two of them.
1. Who are we?  Can't you guess?
K-E-T-T-L-E-S
M-U-S-K-O-K-A
Kettles! Kettles! S.R.A!
2. K-E-T-T-L-E-S
Are we happy? Well! I! guess!
Kettles!  Kettles!  S!R!A!
M-U-S-K-O-K-A
Hurrah!  Kettles!!

There were not enough entries made however and the camp will be open again next year.

When Marjorie's mother reached Father Point a letter came saying that she preferred that Marjorie return home upon her arrival.  This put us in an awful flurry.  We hurried around to find someone going home soon.  No one however was available and as mother would not consent to Marjorie going alone it seemed that she would have to go the next day with Laurie.  Mrs. Campbell advised mother to wait on the chance of someone going and she did so.  The following Friday another letter arrived from Toronto saying Mrs. Beer was sick so she was sent that day

The next week was a serieries of picinics in the Lilliang G? and rides.  A picinic to Waterlily Bay and Bala and a wonderful ride down to East Bay to look at a point on which is a tree the exact counterpart of Spy Glass also to Peter Pan Point, a lovely point next to Cobbs that we are thinking of buying.  I bought some wintergreen from it.  All this week we  went for the mail in the Lilliang? every night.  Once or twice before we had rowed up to Mount Baldy to look at the view it was grand.  Once we met the Andersons at Mortimers Pt and this is the paper from a chocolate bar Sandy gave us each one.

They and the Kids rowed down 3 times, twice to stay to dinner and again to find out our plans.

Once Mother and I went to the little Anglican Church in the Shrimp with the Richardsons and I brought away a seed growing by it.  The service was lovely and the church with its 2 stained glass windows and its ?? and oak pews is perfection.

I am at home now and It is surprising how well I remember every incident.  We had a letter from Miss Harryman and she can float and swim on her back without waterwings.  I am back at school now in #C with Mr. Clark as a form teacher.  I don't see as

I don't see as much of Marjorie as I would like and expected to.  Mrs. Beer brought me a very pretty chain of robins egg beads and a dear little purse from Paris.  I have my last years Final marks now.  I enclose them.  I have been to the Ex lots of times and Marj and I made our 4th anual trip.  I had a candy apple.  We went in the Art Exhibit.

Fri. March 23, 1923
I have started my Sundial again.  Douglas gave me his scrap book and that leaves this free.

Today The meeting of the Nomination Committee of the Maids of Malvern was held.  Miss Symons preided, not really, it was informal.  It was in the Library and we sat around the great big table.  The other girls were seated when I came in so I had to sit at the end of the table facing Miss Symons.  It was thrilling of course but embarrassing.

(Sketch of seating plan) Miss Symon, Evylen Caswell, Marjorie Beer, Doris McCarthy, Mary Norse, Alva Gardiner, Olive Snider

They divided the nominations up into 2 groups, one, the President and the Vice-President - Olive Snider, Alva Gardiner, Eleanor, Beer, Grace Cranston, Mary Norse and Jessie Patterson (subject to Mr. Lehmans approval) in the second group, treasurer and secretary, Marjorie &amp; I, Doris Monroe IB, Edith Niven

Poor Marjorie, Alva had told her pretty certainly that she would be nominated and so she was but she didn't hear her name spoken and sat there in puzzled mortification.  I was giving her congratulatory glances, and she thought they were pitty and was mad at me.  Miss Symons went over all the 1B girls (except M) and Marjorie, being one of the most prominent in 1B couldn't understand it.

One funny thing happened.  ? Evylen had to leave early and so she got up to go and went to the door but, while we were in there, someone, thinking the library was empty had turned

the key in the lock and there we were.  The door into the office was locked too.  Miss Symons went to the window, however and called a boy to come in and unlock it.  It was a lucky, thing, she said that they had noticed it before everyone had gone home.

Rena Oliphant's name came up and one of the girls said that she worked in the library every night.  Miss Symons said that it must be some other girl because Rene never helped her.  Then Evylen explained that it was the children's library.  Miss Symons laughed and said that none other than the school existed for her.

Marjorie and I wish we wern't against each other.

We went to Alva's "discusting group" last night and we had lots of fun but M &amp; I can thing of nothing except voting elections nominations &amp; Miss Symons

Marjorie and I went out to Mrs. McWaters today, and after looking through her scrap book and talking awhile, decided to burry home for it was storming hard.  We got all ready but had to wait some time for a car, and after hearing a whistle which was from the wrong direction, relaxed our viligence and let one get by.  Later fearing to miss a second we went out and stood by the tracks in the blizzard.  One was just coming when to our surprise not unmixed with dismay a car drove up and offered us a lift, and we hopped in.

A man was driving and in the front a girl sat wedged between him and another man while in the back M &amp; I were sitting with another man and girl.  They were singing the awfullest songs (for it was Sunday such as Three O'clock in the morning

Mar 25
which Marjorie and I considered appropriate, Tomorrow, When Francis dances with me, something about "and the wind blows up his trousers" and other similar and even worse things.

Mother was vexed and made me promise never to accept a drive from a stranger again.  
Last night M &amp; I started our scrap books down at Beers.  We had more fun!  I stayed for supper and after, we got going and roared and laughed right up to the time I got home.

On March 17 M&amp; I got out our Bicycles and originated the Royal Order of the Bulls.

March 28
We have ? nothing further about the elections except that 4 votes are allowed.  Piggy? is away so he hasn't passed the nomination list yet.

Monday April 2
Marjorie and I went up town this morning, the Dr. taking us up, and bought our long-saved-up-for books.

We got Rainbow Vally, Annes House of Dreams, David Copperfield, and The Old Curiosity Shop.  Marjorie got ditto minus Annes House of Dreams which she had.

We planned to go for a ride the the afternoon, but Marjorie owing to weariness and a disinclination to go for her music lesson was overtaken by a bilious attack.

Thursday April 5
Marjorie phoned me up this afternoon and I went down there after supper to stay all night.  It was pouring rain but just before I got in it turned to snow which melted as soon as it had fallen.

It was the night of the ex pupils dance and Eleanor was going with Jack.  They were waiting down in the dining room for Sig and Ham who, in the end, phoned that they wouldn't call) so M &amp; I decided to have some fun.  We went to the corner in the stairs from where E could see us but J could not.

We tormented her for a while and then conceived the brain wave of throwing a note via dart, to her.  As we completed it E came upstairs so that plan was off.  We had a dart throwing contest in the livingroom then in which we became so engrossed that we didn't hear E and J go away.

M. showed me Victor Ferriers picture and a write up about his part in the ? in the P.C.I. honour role book.

Harold Ritzer? won the boys.

Friday 13th Apr
We went to see Peter Pan today.  It was wonderful, you can say no more.  It was wonderful.

It is by far the most heautiful think I have ever ever ever seen.

It was at Lowes Uptown.
Peter Pan - He was my ideal Peter.  He had fair curly hair done up on his head his costume was just right.  He was so perfect.  I love the dear way he smiled when he said "And the mauve ones are just dear little sillys who aren't quite sure what they are" and it was the most tragic thing when tinkerbell was dying and he appealed to us to calp if we belived in fairies.  Oh he was sweet.

Liza - I don't understand about her being the author.  She was the tiniest thing and the way she said pouf at Mr. Darlings sleeping in the kennel was awfully cute - she only came in once or twice.

Mr. Darling - He was great.  He was so angry and annoyed when he couldn't get his tie tied.  I got fearfully mad at him when he said so airily (after he was in the kennel) "shut the window, my dear, I feel a draught".

Mrs. Darling - She was awfully nice, but rather stagy?  Not as nice as in the book for this she was just perfect and her kiss?

Wendy - At first I was disappointed in Wendy.  She was dark

and not my idea of Wendy.  But she seemed to live right in the part and I love her now.  She was just as Wendy should have been (except for looks) and as I had always had the haziest idea of how she should look I love her.  She had the dearest way of pouting when Peter didn't know what (besides a devoted son) Wendy wanted him to be to her.  She was sweet when he was singing about the kind of a little house she wanted.

John - Not much to do.  He was very good but not at all prominent.

Michael - He was a perfect dear.  So little and plaintive and shrill.  His anger at his father for skipping the taking of his 

medicine was sweet.

Nana - She was a very clever imitation of a dog and after you got used to her, very nice.

Tinkerbell - At first you were horribly resentful but I cried like a baby when she was dying.  It was the most unique thing, I think, appealing to the audience.

Nibs - One of the lost boys.  There wasn't much diff. between the boys.  Hootles? the one who really shot Wendy wasn't in the play at all.

Slightly - he was a dear little boy but fearfully conceited.  He told the other boys he got ???? being "Slightly soiled

Curly - Curly was the one who shot Wendy
Twins - M. thought their voices were very shrill but I think they were dear
Hook - He was great.  His hook was sticking right out of a bit of log which served for an arm.  His face was all lined and he was terrible looking.  He had a terribly cruel face.
Smee - Smee was the chief of the pirates he was big and fat with a shiny red nose.
Tiger Lily was beautiful and wonderful and romantic.

Thursday April 19
Tonight we went to hear Frances Nickawa.  She was absolutely marvelous.

I got her to autograph a ticket 

afterwards

Sat. April 21
This afternoon mother had just finished washing my hair when M. phoned to say come on down and for a ride.  I hurried and we drove away out to Mimico.  Much to our distress we dod not see the school or the Ferriers.?

We dropped Mrs. McLean at Mimico and then there were only M &amp; I Mrs and Dr. Beer left.

At Sunnyside we stopped at St. Josephs Hospital where the Dr. had to make a call.  While we were there a car containing some nuns drove up and honest true one of the nuns winked at the chaufeur as she paid him.

I had my first ice cream cone of the season.

Monday 23
M &amp; I went down to hear the Mill Rd oratorical contest.  It was punk(?).  Margaret Dixon came first and               second. (They weren't a patch on last year)

Today was the Maids of Malvern meeting.  M &amp; I were so excited.

Mary was elected President.  We were wildly joyful.

Olive Snider - Vice - we were glad too because it would have been fierce if she'd been left off after all the work she did last year.

Yvonne Robarts secretary (not so much joy.  M &amp; I clutch each other closer.

Marjorie Beer Treasurer.  Hurrah.

I was horribly disappointed.  I never realized till then how much I had allowed myself to hope.  And Nancy Laing was 3rd.

I was fearfully humiliated.  My pride had never before received such a jolt.

E. Beer came 3rd.

Thursday 26
Today is the Duke of Yorks Wedding Day.  There's a lovely account of it in the Star but the Star has been destroyed.

Mother fell down stairs and hurt herself badly.  She went went out to Ferriers AND WE CAN HAVE SILVER ISLAND.

We went to "Camp Beans" today and had lots of fun.  Marjorie had to play at a recital first so  I went up with Helen Bailey.  We changed into bloomers ect. up there.

Tuskorora's due (we say) to the absence of any running shoes in our group".

They had a nice supper supplemented by "gore" as before M arrived just as were were starting.  After supper there was a lovely talk and songs ect.

Tuesday - May Day - Play day.
Marjorie and I went out to Mrs. MacWaters where we acted "The Plight of the Flowers" twice.

We stayed for supper and coming home I hurriedly played Balk and we went over to the pageant at the Beach Ave Meth church where we had to stand and which we decided to be vastly inferior to aforesaid Plight of the Flowers.

Daddy and I walked down to Scarborough for the first time this year and walked around seeing all.  Its much better than last year and cheaper.  I went on the shoots (sometimes spelt chutes (but not often).

Sat. May 26
May 10.  In the 10th M and I went at to Stop 3 to pick violets.  We got quarts.  We saw someone who looked dreadfully like Eric.  We wonder if it was - and!! we saw and spoke to the Rodgers girls.  They're going up there for seven lucky days.  Where of course - Silver Island.  If Ken gets a sup - or if Ken doesnt get a supp, we'll go.

thats the best news you could have given me.  Oh! we're so glad.  I just knew!

I knew Ken's results were out and I knew Ken had passed.

I ran into the house and it was true.  I just ran upstairs and hugged all the comforter and thanked God.  Oh it was wonderful I felt so happy I didn't dare believe it.  It was that forever blessed Mr. Westman whom Ken had had for supper one night.

All our terrible despairing ? fears that he would fail or have a sup and that we couldn't go to Silver Island were groundless.  WE CAN GO.

I phoned up M. but the fudge had forced her to be slightly indisposed and she was sleeping.  That news cured her.

Sunday June 3
We had a good time at the Rouge today.  It was lovely.  The apple blossoms were all out and the roads? were paradise except under the car.

Friday 8.  Mother left today for Quebec.

Monday 11
Alva, Audrey and I took an affectionate farewell ??  Tho we little guessed it it was to be a last goodbye - but, that is at least until next year.

I was heart broken to leave the dear old place but ever day brings Silver Island 24 hours nearer.

Wed 20.  Marjorie and I so busy planning for Silver Island and stringing beads.

Today we went up to the school to get our reports.  I was overjoyed to see Alva but alas Alas - such being life

the packing and settled down to wait.  About 9.00 Oliphant came and carted the trunks, bagage, Daddy and Doug away.  Then mother and I put in a long 3/4 of an hour waiting for Dr. Beer.  Laurie came down to say goodbye before Oliphant came.  I made some tags for our umberellas and played Peggy O'neil on the piano until at last, to our overwhelming relief we heard Dr. Beer.

He took us down to 2212 where he dropped Harry who had come for the ride and picked up Marjorie who was very excited and full of parcels.  We drove to the station where we met Daddy and Doug and the trunks.  M &amp; I hurriedly hunted for some place to weigh ourselves but were not successful in finding one.

We had just time to walk

up and down the platform playing Polly and Peter when a train came in, which, however, proved to be GBR(?) from Chicago.  M, after this had gone by dint of writing notes and catching Daddy's eye, managed to convey to him that she was sending the Mail and (?) to Silver Island and there was no need of him to do so also.

At last our train came and then what excitement there was.  We were all bustled on and in the confusion M. lost her father and didn't have a proper chance to say goodbye to him.  It was deliciously exciting, and confusing and hilarious.

After we were comfortable settled M started to read Christopher and Columbus.

But we were interrupted by mother who was telling us that the quiet little boy sitting in the seat behind us had turned out to be the boy who was taking Erics place.

Mother had discovered him by admiring his lovely boxes of worms, and after asking him where he was bound for discovered to her surprise that it was for Bala Park.

"What part of Bala Park" she asked and he answered "Silver Island".

M found out where the Ferriers were.  We had a happy reunion with them.  Miss Irene who was not present was coming up with Chester on Monday.

It took quite a while for us to finish our little reunion and just before we went mother started talking politics and got into quite an argument with Mr. Ferrier whose big booming voice sounded down the car "Well I voted for a Conservative candidate anyway".  We were glad to pull mother back to our car.

At last we arrived at Bala Park after having had lobster and Ham sandwhiches for lunch and having, as last year, thrown some silly notes to YOU.  Mortimer was at the dock to meet us.  The Moors, Ferriers and we were all wanting to be accomodated.  Eddie took us and the Moors home.  Oh how wonderful it was when we saw Spy Glass.  M's eye worried her considerably.

It did not take us long to settle as the supplies, to our consternation did not come.

And here we are all settled.  All there is to live for is some Silver Island toast and Tomorrow.

Fri. June 29
Today we went all around the Island and it was joy to see the dear places again.  I love them.

After we came home we helped Doug (?) out the well and had lots of fun doing so especially as we spilt a plentious supply on Doug's nose (he was down in the well).  His faces were comical.

Tonight we went over to Campbells and heard Springfield Mass., Pittsburg Schenectady, New York, Zion City's sacred concert Philadephia Chicago, &amp; Louisville Kentuck.

Sat. June 30
M and I were washing dishes today when we heard Mortimer's launch draw up at our dock and thinking it must be Irene we dashed out.  To our amazement it was the BEERS.

We have never been so surprised in all our life.  They packed us right in and we all dashed over to Dunbarton which the Beers just LOVE.

There were continual goings back and forth all day and M and I had supper over there at which we were very glad for supplies are fearsomly low over here.

Hurrah the supplies have come.  About 1/2 past ten and we just had to leave them there.

It was too dark to carry them up tonight.

I forgot to say that I went in bathing for the first time this year.  The water was great considering but M couldn't go in.

Sunday July 1
We were awakenend this morning by the boarse cries of gulls or crows whom mother thought had been attracted by the smells of our supplies on the dock.  We dressed and lugged our things up to the house.  We found when all to goods had been unpacked that almost 1/3 had not been sent.  About 11 o'clock Mrs. and Dr. Beer &amp; Harry &amp; Eleanor came over for a swim after which Marjorie noticed that her watch was missing she however thought that her mother must have it.


After dinner we finished Christopher and Columbus and shortly went over to Dunbarton.  Dr. Beers was sitting on the canvas camp lounging chair when - rip and he was through it.  It was the funniest thing I think I've ever seen.  His feet were sticking up and he was sitting on the floor.  Marjorie and I paddled to Innis Fallen with the others in the row boat and then to Duck from where we came home.  Marjorie put her foot through Duck's verandah.  Mother finding Mrs Beer didn't have M's watch combed the sand diligently but finally it was found in Mrs. Beer's shoe.  Eleanor stayed for supper which we ate on the front verandah where I killed my head on the wall.

Monday July 2
M &amp; I hung pictures all morning.  We have completed the ? &amp; ? the arts corner revised the babies(?), and collected enough for a wonderful eat corner.  Dr. Beer and Eleanor left for Toronto. E to go to camp from there

When M and I were going down swimming we met Gwen and Denta.  Gwen is really very pretty and nice and Denta thought not so nice looking is a nice girl.  They are sort of the maids at Campbell's.

M and I went to Dunbarton for tea.

Tuesday June 2
The supply boat started today.  The captain is just the same only more so.  We started Daylight Saving to-day and Mother and I at least like it much better.  Mother caught a beautiful big bass and Marjorie and I cleaned it and sent  over to Dunbarton for their supper.

Wed. 4th of July
The Beers were here for a liver and bacon dinner today.  M and I played Mrs Blair ? editor of the "Pine needle", and Mrs. Van Arsdale (only other woman) editor of the "Fir Tree".  We had lots of fun.  In the afternoon our supplies arrived and we unpacked them and put them away.  I hurt my feet some way and its been the sorest thing I can hardly walk.  Its the upper part of my leg(?).  Harry caught a lovely bass.  For some unknown reason the fishing this year has been wonderful.  Marjorie and I have been kept busy cleaning them.  We like Walter he's fearfully quiet but awfully nice.  Everyones down on ppr Eric.

Thursday July 5
This morning Doug took Marjorie and I for a paddle to Shadow Bay about which I had written in my comp.  It wasn't much like what I expected but it was very pretty.  Irene arrived this afternoon but the tennis net wont come till tomorrow.  Mother said Mrs. Campbell had been speaking to her about our not having been over so we went this afternoon.

      <dc:description>Doris McCarthy's personal journal from ages twelve to fourteen. Doris McCarthy started writing with Marjorie for the school newspaper.  Both of them developed an interest in authorship and deicded they would ask for diaries on Christmas 1921. Doris started her first journal, this one, on New Year's day, 1922. Because Doris' journal was blank, she could write whenever and however much she wanted to on the pages. Doris also developed the habit of drawing/sketching at the same time as here interest in writing. Although there are some sketches in the journals, she \primarily used other exercise books for drawing.
Marjorie and I were nearly bored stiff when Dr. Blackader came down and showed us all his collection of wild flowers though it was really very interesting.  We went up for the mail in the canoe with Doug.  All the held up mail was there and I got a letter from Audrey and a 2lb box of Lauras from Dad though I didn't know it then and wrote Ken thanking him.  I gathered a boquet of ? big purple ? and daisies from a huge fragrant field of them behind the Wingberry(?).  M &amp; I went to the ? Pt Library on our way home and got Sewing Seeds in Danny the Sky Pilot and a book by Frances Hodgen Burnett.

Christmas 1922

Friday July 6
This morning as I was getting dressed I heard Ronny Campbell talking to mother whereupon I immediately raced and closed all the doors.  When I was dressed Mother told me that he had come to say that we could go to Bala with him in the Bunty(?) if we'd be ready in 20 mts.  Marjorie was sleeping over at Dunbarton so Doug, after a few vain(?) attempts to wake her went over in the canoe and brought her home where we at a few bites of breakfast and hurried over to Campbell's.  We enjoyed our trip very much and

fun.  The water was exceptionally warm.  We went over to Ronnys after supper but the Radio(?) wasn't very good so we left early and Marjorie and I had a Birthday bathe(?).  My!  They are wonderful.  The supply boat didnt come, much to our consternation.

July the seventh.  My Birthday.  Marjorie and I got up fairly early this morning and went down to the docks to  see if there was anything on the lines to our mingled joy astonishment and dismay there was a catfish.  Claiming him for our own we cleaned him and - well, least said soonest mended.  It was awful.  After we had it head cut of its tail and fins also(?) off it insides out and it partly skinned it was wiggling.

When we came home breakfast was ready and Oh! Joy, sitting on my chair was a darling little No.2 Brownie.  I love it and it was the biggest surprise.  It was from Marjorie.  After breakfast M &amp; I paddled over to Dunbarton where Mr. MacWaters (naughty man) gave me 2 dollars and Mrs. Beer, ???.  I had the happiest birthday.  M &amp; I had our Indian spyglass ceremony today and the great mystery of the postcard from ? developed.  We also had our grand scramble while Doug was trying to obtain privacy in his bedroom and we locked him in.  When we went bathing Doug and May and I had a grand water scramble in which we pushed each other into the water.

Sat 14
There were ? on the water.  After dinner I wrote Miss Baskerville and went over to Dunbarton where we read Emmy Lou and played solitaire.  At last we saw Daddy's canoe coming and went home in the row boat.  I accidently splashed Marjorie whereupon she moved up into the bow, whereupon I splashed her purposely to make her come back to the result of her arriving soaking wet.  While she was changing her clothes Daddy arrived.  We went in swimming shortly after and Daddy was surprised to see us dive.  When I went in the 2nd time Doug followed and Daddy not to be outdone by us came in too.  He can dive great and that was the first time he had ever tried.

After supper we went over to Dunbarton to watch for their arrival which as late.

We, m and I got up at 7 this morning to play tennis.  M couldn't find the other ball and had an awfully time until Doug E. and Roy came up about 7.40 with the other one and kicked us off the court.  When we were in swimming this morning the supply boat came and we went over in our bathing suits.

We played Rig(?) over at Dunbarton till about 5 O'clock about which time  we recollected that we were going to Baldy for supper.

Marjorie and I played out "play ?? game until we reached the dock in front of the little church where I wound up the irksome and nerve-rending game by melee.

Oh Eleanor! or rather trying to say it.  The next thing I remember was a dream.  I felt sure I was not really at Silver Island.  Seem to remember E's torn pink bathing suit lying on the beach and seeing the torn edge of E's pink bathing suit.  Then I remember lying on the beach with the Dr. F beding over me.

I took off my cap and lay there for along time.  Mother forbade me going in swimming again when she heard and diving finally and lastly, nothing.

We were with Eleanor and Mrs MacWaters a lot.  Strange to relate Marjorie coaxed me onto the Flyer.  Never again! (till next year)

The School (bless it) had a farewell presentation to Miss Symons and gave her a lovely 1/2 doz. sherbert glasses.  She looked a dream.

Sep. 6  I got my little sister Kathleen ? today.  She's a darling and not very tall.

Mon. Dec.26

I went down to Bobs to listen in on her Radio tonight and when I came home Ken told me that Marjorie had asked me to phone her.

Guess what it was.  Small Edwin Charles had been born at nine o'clock.  Marjorie was so excited she could hardly speak.

We had our corn roast early in October or late in September.  It was a great success.  The most romantic moment of my whole life was when I passed the gate of Le chateau des quatre Vends - the loveliest name for a house on a big bluff overlooking the lake I can imagine, and when we were walking down the hundred steps it was dark and silent.  A mist hung over the water but the moon shone across it.  I seemed to be truly walking on air.  I'll never forget the wiers(?) mystery and delight of the moment.

Mother and I went to see Bransby Williams in David Copperfield today.  It is the most beautiful play I've ever seen.  Words cannot express.  Agnes was sweet!!

Mr. Micawber was marvelous.  He was just as he should have been!  I cant describe them all but i was disappointed only in David himself.  Mrs. Gummige was great.

I have made a Radio set.  It is great when it works.

Marge and me and Dad went to hear Bliss Carmen.  I was a trifle disappointed.

and lastly (sketch of coffee? cup)

After supper we played musical chairs and danced.  It was quite exciting.  Doug saved me from utter mortification by dancing with me.

A few days before Christmas we went up to the school and packed the boxes for our poor families.  My girl was 15 years old, Florence Primrose.  I have put a sprig of holly left over into my treasure book.

Thursday Dec 27
I went to see A Midsummer Nights dream today.  It was awfully pretty.  The fairies were dears.  In the morning mother and I went uptown to choose me a dress.  We met Marjorie and Eleanor and the doctor and had a little family reunion.  There was the most desperate sale on.

Dr. Beer is running for board of Education again and it is going to be a stiff fight.

Oct 4 1924
It is almost a year since I wrote in my diary  last and so much has happened in that time.

I have been to Silver Island for another summer.  Mother was so sick she didn't think she would be able to go so Douglas, Harvey and myself went on Thursday the 3rd.  Miss Baskerville joined us on Saturday.  The following Saturday Marjorie arrived and on the 18th.  Mother and Daddy came up a few days later.  Aunt Nell went home and Miss, Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins came.  Harvey also left.  On the ?th of August Mother, Douglas, Marjorie and I, came home.

But what I really wanted to tell you about, Little Diary is

very very exciting.

For the first time in my life I have been taken out by a boy.  It was almost 2 weeks ago Sept. the 22nd to the 5th forms corn roast.

Glen Hoffman phoned me up on Thursday and asked me if I would like to go to the corn roast with Jimmie Cunningham.  I scarcely knew what to say I was so flustered and Doug shouted into the phone that I had to be home by ten o'clock to have my bath.  I could hear Glen repeat it to Jimmie and I heard them roar and laugh.  I shut down the phone I felt so mortified.  Doug and Laurie were down and I should like to have canned them.  A few minutes afterward the phone rang again and it was Hoffman again.  I said no thank you and shut off.  I have never felt so queer before.  I wanted to go just as badly as could be but I couldn't accept an invitation by proxy.  Nearly all that night I lay awake thinking of what  I should have said.

I walked home from school with Audrey Mellons and Marjorie and stayed in all Friday afternoon on the hopes that he might phone.

It was Jimmie this time so I told him  to phone again in the evening and I would be able to tell him whether I could go or not.  We played Mah Jong all evening and I was so excited I could hardly wait.  It was about 1/2 past eight when he phoned.  The corn roast was to be held on Saturday and can you imagine my feeling when I saw that it was pouring rain.  I stayed in the house all day hoping it would clear up but about 7 o'clock Jimmie phoned to say that it was postponed till Monday.

Monday was a gloomy day but better than Sunday.  I put on a middie and my new wool crepe blue skirt and borrowed ? pins for my tie.  Marjorie was going with Glenn.  She wouldn't have been able to go on Saturday so I was awfully glad it had been postponed.  I expected to feel rather silly anyway at the fifth form corn roast especially after the way Jimmie had been teased already.  He came about about ten past seven.  I went to the door.  It was thrilling!!  I just had to slip on my red sweater.  There was rather an awkward pause just at the door.  Jimmie didn't seem to want to go or something.  He seemed to be waiting for something and I didn't like to push him out or anything.  He asked me where Doug was and I thought he wanted to see him but I didn't take the hint.  Once we got comfortable out of the house everything went smoothly.  To my surprise it had cleared up beautifully and the stars were all shining.  It was a nice walk down to Norris's where the corn roast was held and thanks to Marjorie and Audrey due to the fact that Eleanor Beer was at Whitby College the conversation didn't lag.  I asked him about the night he and Hoff had taken us home from the Hockey game and he thought it was a great joke.  We didn't see any sign of Marjorie on the way down.  We walked down the hundred steps and speculated as to how many there really are.  I think it is 144.  Jimmie said that his idea of earthly bliss used to be to walk up and down those steps and count them.  There didn't seem to be any sign of anyone when we got down there but we soon found a bunch of the girls.  Do Dodd, ? Watson, Lillian Tattersall(?), Kay Hardy, Jean Martin

and all that bunch.  It was so very dark that they couldn't see us and it was most embarrassing explaining who we were.  They all laughed.  We were only the second installment of arrivals.  We waited around for quite a while and finally Lillian ? and Do Dodd went up the steps again to see what was doing.  As they didn't reappear we followed them and finally discovered that nearly everyone had gone through ? and down their steps onto the beach.  We went down to.  It was thrilling.  It was so dark you couldn't see ahead of you and you had to guess where the steps were and there was always the danger of falling.  They had brought heaps of wood with them and they started to light the fire when someone discovered that there was no paper so someone climbed up to the house to get some.

The fire was lighted and it was about nine O'clock when Karjorie and Hoffman arrived.  We sat around and talked mostly until Doug arrived with the fair Helen (Sanderson).  He started some games and we played farmer in his den, in and out window and French Tag.  Mr. Blaney was there.  Then they brought on the eats.  It was glorious to feel you were really and just as much "in it" as everyone else.  Neither Marjorie nor I really like Hoffman but Jimmieis as nice as can be.  Mary sat and played the uke and sang to us while we ate.  She knows lots more camp songs.  When we had just about finished our buns and weiners Jimmie and Hoff arrived with bottle of pop.  We were terribly thirsty and they did taste good until we got over out thirst.  It really was vile.

but it was such nice feeling to be waited on and fetched for I didn't care.  I spilt as much of it as I could on the sand so that helped.

Not long after we climbed up to the house and went up to  Mary's room to get ready for dancing.  Marjorie and I emptied our shoes over the balcony and into Do Dodds hair.  Then we went downstairs to the livingroom.  I was a perfect wall flower.  Doug asked me for the tag dance. Ted Sanderson tagged me and kept me for another dance.  Otherwise I was a wall-flower.  As for Jimmie and Hoffman.  They had vanished into thin air. There were quite a few other wallflowers so I didn't mind.  Marjorie dances were nearly all taken.

They passed lemonade around in between 2 of the dances then to finish up with we gave three cheers for the ?

Harvey was down but of course did not dance except one dance with Mary who as M says is just like a sister to him.
 
If it was the noise of the cheers or what, Jimmie and Hoff were on deck when we came down but they didn't say anything about why they had disappeared.  I don't suppose they could dance and I guess they decided that would be the simplest way of getting over the difficulty.  The four of us stayed together until we left Marjorie at 2212 and then Hoffman left up at the corner of Balsam and Queen.

Jimmie and I parted at the steps.  We talked for a few minutes and then I went it.  I was so thankful that the front door was open.  Mother was still awake and waiting for me.

Both of them developed an interest in authorship and deicded they would ask for diaries on Christmas 1921. Doris started her first journal, this one, on New Year's day, 1922. Because Doris' journal was blank, she could write whenever and however much she wanted to on the pages. Doris also developed the habit of drawing/sketching at the same time as here interest in writing. Although there are some sketches in the journals, she \primarily used other exercise books for drawing.
I lay awake for quite a while in a happy daze but I was so tired that I finally went to sleep.  

Jimmie is back at his old trick of ignoring me in the halls at Malvern.  I wonder if he will ask me to anything else.

(Margin:  I just made a very mortifying discovery Mrs. ? told Marjorie.  When Glenn phoned up the first time he asked me to go with himself and not with Jimmie at all.)

The first rugby game of the season was yesterday at Scarboro against Jarvis.

Douglas is playing Senior this year.  His team was beaten 12-20 but we beat their Juniors 28-0.

Oct 22
The 1st, 2nd and third Rugby games are over. We beat Jarvis at Scarborough Park 28-0 and Central Tech at Don flats 60-0.  Then we met Oakwood at Scarborough.  It was a lovely day but everyone was frightened silly.  Did we lose - no my dear friends - we did not lose - we beat them 40-0.

It is my opinion that we'll never have a point scored against us and the last 2 times one of our best players was off at Central Tech Red Moores and at Scarborough Pat Taylor.

I am Discussion Groups on the cabinet this year.  I am just getting it organized today.

I have had a class since early last spring (at Sunday school.  It is very interesting and I wouldn't miss teachers meeting (Tuesday nights) for anything.

Baby Ben is huge.  He is almost 11 months old and is just walking.  He can stand up alone wonderfully and Marjorie told me yesterday that he has taken his first step.

His "Marjorie and Eleanor" teeth have been succeeded by many others.  He's a perfect darling and I'm so glad that he doesn't make strange with me.

Red Breast
John Oxenham

I saw one hanging on a tree
And O his face was sad to see, -
Misery, misery me!

There were berries red upon his head
And in his hands and on his feet
But when I tried to pick and eat
They were his blood and he was dead, -
Misery, misery me!

It broke my heart to see him there
So lone and sad in his despair
The marks of woe were in his hands
And through his feet, - oh misery me!

With beak and claws I did my best
To loose the nails and set him free,
But they were all too strong for me, -
Mysery, misery me!

I pushed and pulled and did my best
And his red blood stained all my breast
I bit the nails, I picked the thorns
O never saw I thorns so worn
But yet I could not get him free, -
Misery, misery me!

And never since have I feared ?
But ever I seek him when I can
And let him see the wish in me
To ease him of his misery.

sleep, fresh air

Mr Horton has given me I+ in both my compositions.  The first was about settling us in the cottage and the second about exploring Innis Fallen.  In the first lot no-one else got so high and he made me read mine aloud.  In the second lot he excused me.  ??? very partial I don't think it means much.  Audrey and myself are taking art.  We've a terrible crush on backgrounds.

We're doing a pumpkin just now because we've just finished putting backgrounds on all the things we had painted.

I'm not taking music lessons any more.

We beat Harbord in the finals 24-0.  Its all in my Treasure Book.

On Hallow-e'en Eleanor was home from Whitby.  She had a birthday party or rather a Hallow-e'en dance.  All the crowd were there.  Seymour Wilson was also there.  He is a teacher at St. Aidans is in 4B comes into our room for History and has walked home from teachers meeting with me once.  At the game with Riverdale at Scarborough he made a marvellous run of about 50 yards to Malvern's goal for which he became overnight to the highest pinnacle of renown.  He'll never hear the last of it.  Such kind remarks as "Got your compass Seymour" greeted his arrival at the next game.  He's awfully nice and lots of fun.  He has been living on a farm until this year and he's taking his H.S. course in 3 years.

				A DAY AT THE KNOTHOLE


	It is a good morning when I wake in time to see the sun open a red eye above the trees on the eastern shore of the bay. At this hour I can be leisurely about the coffee that I take back to bed, sipping it slowly, and staring between sips. The sky is gradually gaining colour above the heat haze which dims the far shore and the distant islands. A song sparrow flits on to the brush pile beside the stone fireplace on the rocks, and opens beak and throat in a burst of music. I watch a tubular brown mole scud from under the brush across the open rock into the sanctuary of the mossy hollow where the iris and the St. John's wort are in bloom. The gulls that were laughing and screaming at dawn have gone fishing, but a sandpiper lands on their favourite rock island, that lies like a giant half.submerged just off the shore. I watch him bob his way along the water edge up to the giant's head. Is it shad flies he's finding? There goes our resident beaver, a brown head leaving a silver wake as he glides smoothly past, off to work in the beaver meadow beyond the blasted channel, no doubt. He comes back to his home in the Keyhole bay at dusk every evening like a city commuter. I should take the hint and get going myself.
	
	One of the pleasures of life at the cottage is the pine-carpetted path to the privy. Overnight as usual; the spiders have

stretched webs from side to side, and the sun catches them just before they catch me in the face. Yesterday's sweep-out didn't
get rid of the spiders, but I miss the heap of dried leaves and grasses from the shelf inside. For two years a red squirrel
lived in that nest, and when surprised at night would lean out with his black button eyes, and then scurry along the top of the door and up over the roof. Now I have only old New Yorkers for company. Through the screen of pines and cedar undergrowth I see the sun sparkling on the bay, beckoning.
	Back at the cottage,I wrap the big towel around me, slide into my sandals, and pick up face cloth and soap on my way to the place where the rock goes smoothly off into deep water. Holding soap and face cloth high I venture one step into the wet - and slide the rest of the way. It's always comic when I find myself helpless to stop until I have reached deep water or fallen with a great splash beside the ledge that I use to pull myself out with. I soap, rinse and wallow, luxuriating in the sweet cold water At this hour I have the bay to myself. Virginia is probably awake, but never admits it until I am dressed, with my bed made, and she hears the wind chimes on the clothes line ring out, as I jerk them in hanging up my towel.

	The cabin is tidied for the day, both beds orderly in their day covers, and the breakfast table inviting when we sit down together. I wait for Virginia's daily "I'm not awake yet", a ritual opening. After that I talk for both of us, reviewing the
folds, staple holes, rust stains, pencil</dc:description>

night, reporting the heron or other incidents of my coffee hour, commenting on the weather prospects of the day, no answer demanded. I clear the table and leave her sitting over her second cup of tea. It is still just after eight o'clock, and my morning is off to a good start.

	The studio greets me with its familiar smell of sun-baked cedar and turpentine. The big canvas of the Mendenhall Glacier that I was working on yesterday confronts me from the easel. I open up my aluminum arm chair amd make myself comfortable in front of it. Any duck families on the bay this morning? The islands and the far shore are clearing. So how does the glacier look twelve hours later? The composition is still all right. I like the way it pulls your eye from the cloud-hung mountain down at an angle, and twists you again into the foreground. The near hill on the right seems a bit jumpy. Does that mean that the tone contrast is too strong? Let me lighten it.
	My palette is laid out from yesterday, but I check to be sure that all the colours are in good supply. I reach for a tube of white and start to unscrew the top before I remember gloves. Damn! This recent allergic reaction to turps is a curse! Oh well. Special hand cream first, hands waved in the air to speed drying, rubber gloves that I peeled off last night blown right side out and pulled on, painting apron tied around, and now, at last, the tube of white again.

	The next time I leave the glacier is when the wheeze of the hand pump at the back door and the ring of the pot lid tells me that Ginny has finished in the kitchen and is putting washing to soak in the big pot on the wash stand outside. Half an hour later she is at her own easel beside her own stretch of windows facing the bay. If she comments on my work it is a good sign and I go on with renewed confidence. We are normally supportive of eachother. But if there is silence I look more critically at what I am doing. Sometimes I will ask for a criticism, sometimes set my teeth and press doggedly on. After a bit I realize that I have been whistling the same fragment of something or other all morning. "Sorry," I mutter. "Just change it", she suggests gently, and I do, at least temporarily.

	We break to split a beer sometime during the morning. Today it is cool enough to enjoy the sun, so we sit up on the rocks in
front of the cottage. The cedar chairs stay out all summer, but last year's stain seems to be holding up well. As outside maintenance man it is my job to keep an eye on such things.	
Chippie runs out from between two of the fireplace rocks, and sits, hand on heart, observing us. I go in to get some peanuts for him but he is off before I return. We put a few on the coffee table to tempt him back, and settle to enjoy the gulls, the movement of the water against the shore, the launches coming down the channel from Parry Sound, the wind surfers, and any signs of life we can observe around the cottages on the far shore

or on the islands. Ginny decides that her work will be dry enough to go on with by now, and I return eagerly to the glacier.

	By lunch time it is too hot on the rocks. We carry the tray and our chairs to the shade of the grove of pin cherry trees in front of the studio, and watch the barn swallows feeding their young in the nest under the eaves. Those big red mouths! How do the parents keep track of which ones get fed each time?

	Our official working day ends at four o'clock when our friends from the other two "holes" join us for tea. The cottages are held in a partnership, which gives their owners a sense of being a family. The largest is called the "Keyhole" after the little back bay which is roughly that shape. Ginny's and mine is known as the "Knothole", because it is not the Keyhole, and it is more rustic. The third cottage, out of sight beyond the big point, is the smallest of the three, and seemed well described as the "Cubbyhole". Ginny's brother named the high place which overlooks the peninsula on which the cottages lie, "Ben Hole".
	I carry enough chairs and the tea table to the sheltered side of the house. Ginny has the big tray set with everything needed and the kettle almost at the boil as our friends drift in. Tea is welcome and the home-made cookies appreciated, but the real attraction is the hour of reading together afterwards. When the day's chit chat is slowing and the blue china mugs refilled all around, the first reader starts.

	We have tried quite a variety of book in the last few years, from Frye"s "The Great Code" to a P.D.James mystery. This year I
have persuaded us to have a go at Dorothy L. Sayers' "The Mind of the Maker".  We have good critical capacities in the group and some experience in thinking theologically and philosophically. Today we are reading and discussing Sayers1 chapter about free  will and miracle. It is always too soon that someone remembers the time, and we break for the day, still arguing.

	Virginia is chief chef. While I wash up the tea mugs, her head is in the refrigerator, setting in motion her well-organized plans for a good dinner. This is my hour for what I call road work, cutting dead limbs from trees, pruning lower branches to coax a tree to grow higher, shaping and changing. Today I am going to look for a big flat rock to widen the front step at the "Keyhole". I take the precaution of changing from sandals to rubber boots. The rock I find, is a segment cracked loose when the Hydro workers blasted to install our pole. The back of my intended rock is buried in moss and earth that I must scrape away to find its extent. There is a little overhang on one edge which will give me a chance to get a lever under. The wrecking bar won't do, too small, rock too heavy. But this six foot length of two by four, with a rock as a fulcrum, lets me lift it an inch or so. If I sit on the end of the two by four to hold it down and the rock up, I can use the rake to push a small rock under the edge. That will hold it up while I reposition the lever, and pry

the big rock up high enough to get the end of one of the rollers under it. I repeat the process, shoving, putting all my weight on the end of my two by four, getting the rollers under, inch by inch, until I can begin to think of coaxing the big rock to move forward. Enough for today. I drop tools where they are, ready to go on with it tomorrow, peel my sticky clothes off my wet back,
wrap the big towel about me and make for the bay.
	Sweet water! But it takes several duckings and sloshings before I stop tasting the salt. Today I soap my hair too, and lie back in the water feeling the little waves rinsing it for me. Ginny has the pots bubbling and a drink in her hand by the time I am dressed, but there's still time for a quick one for me.
We take dinner seriously, the table formally set, the window beside it giving us pine trees for our candles, the ripening grasses and mulleins outside as our floral decoration, but on the table the lovely old blue flowered china that came with the cottage and our own sparkling glasses. The vegetable garden is producing well this year, beet greens and snow peas already, and the first of the tomatoes, red as a harbour buoy. My elderberry wine is a contralto note in the symphony of colour. Ginny pours herself another glass of it while I look after the washing up and carry the bowl of kitchen scraps over to the compost pile beside the garden.
	The sun is low by now, sending long shadows across the rocks, catching the brilliant white of the gulls riding in the bay, reflecting back from windows on the far island. We set out on our

evening walk, choosing the shore route rather than the road to the post box this time. The water level has dropped, uncovering broad ledges of rock, leaving puddles that we can explore. Tonight, for the first time this season, we can get dry shod to the end of the long point.The gulls fly off screaming as we approach. Purple splotches on the rocks tell us that they have been raiding the blueberry bushes. Having explored the point in detail, we turn inland up through the juniper bushes, past the grove of big pines where my niece pitched her tent last year, up the long spine of glacier-scraped granite that leads to the high place. In the little hollows where dust has gathered and made soil, the tall grasses are ripening, moving in the breeze like the flaxen hair of the goosegirl in the fairy tale.
	At the top of the hill we settle. I lie on the sun-warmed rock with my head propped on the log of drift wood that we rolled into position up there years ago. Ginny sits beside me on the thickest part of the log, where arthritic knees have less difficulty getting up. We are monarchs surveying our kingdom. Rock by rock, tree by tree, we approve it. Each of the three hydro poles has its own herring gull on top. Good. Joe, our permanent resident ringbill, is patrolling in front of the cottage, screaming protest at any other gull who drifts in, and driving him off. Good. We watch a family of mergansers scramble up on to the Giant and settle into a tight cluster around mother, whose head flicks back and forwards in vigilance before she too settles for the night. Good.

	When the sun drops out of sight below the woods behind us and Ginny slaps the first mosquito, I take it as a cue. Our return to the cottage is direct, accelerated by our unspoken eagerness for the penultimate chapter of the day. I carry the lamp to the table while Ginny brings the Scrabble box. She lays things out deftly. The poor board is shabby, stained with blood from many mosquitoes, worn with years of use. We set aside the lid in which records of notable scores are preserved, and fish out last night's score paper on which there is still space.
	"Let's hope I don't have another run of vowels", Ginny murmurs. "None at all is just as bad", I answer.
	We play sociable Scrabble, each more interested in high scores than in competition. If the board becomes too strangled, or a hand presents insuperable difficulties, the player spreads out the letters and we both study them to find a play. Our satisfaction with the achievement of a full seven letter word is mutual. Tonight is notable because I managed to get the word "eczema" on a triple for the very good score of sixty, and Ginny, who had been holding her breath while I decided where to play, let out a cry fo triumph because "warding", the seven letter wore she had hoped to be able to play, could join with my "a" to become "awarding", an eight letter word that added up to a score of eighty

	Once in bed, Ginny is apt to read longer that I. When the words begin to run together or I find my eyes closing over my book, I

	This house grew by bits and pieces as I could afford to
give myself more needed space.  It is therefore unconventional in
many ways and will be better enjoyed when its eccentricities are
understood.

	The first part to be built, in 1940, was a small
cottage, in which only one room was finished, the livingroom,
which was insulated and lined by the original builder.  Walls and
ceiling were all of knotty pine, with a meagre half inch of
"tentest". a sort of fibre board, as insulation between the pine
ceiling and the asphalt shingles of the roof.  The house was
placed on a foundation of concrete block and brick posts with
crawl space below.  There is still crawl space below porch,
living-room and bedroom.  Later, a cellar was excavated beneath
the kitchen and bathroom of the original cottage.

	The only heat at this time was the fireplace, a
"heatilator" which draws cold air into the vents at floor level.
That air is warmed in a chamber behind and escapes as warm air
from the vents on the mantel piece.

	During and immediately after the war the rest of the
cottage, as it was then, was wired for electricity, a pine

ceiling installed and insulated with sawdust.  The outside walls
were insulated and all walls were lined with knotty pine.  Just
after the war it was impossible to find a building contractor so
I became my own builder, hiring tradesmen to do technical jobs
that were beyond my skills.  N.B. The electrician who wired the
living-room left it so that all the outlets on the west wall are
controlled by a switch in the hall.  Those on the east wall are
always live.

	At some point I installed a pull-down staircase in the
hall ceiling, and laid some flooring above the ceiling rafters to
create an attic which was accessible.  This gave me some storage
space. That original pull-down was quick and easy until I fell
against it one day and twisted the hinges.  It never recovered.

	Its successor is neither quick nor easy.  To get up
into the attic use the rod with a hook in the end (stored at
present on the broom cupboard) to get hold of the eye in the trap
door.  Pull it down very gently.  Push the centre of the hinges
away from you so that when you pull down the folded section the
top part does not start to lift.  The light switch for the attic
is on a rafter at the top of the ladder.  There is very little
head room, so navigate cautiously.  My intention is to have the
attic empty before there are any tenancies so that there is
little occasion for going up, unless to ensure that no animal has

found a way in or to investigate the source of a leak in the
roof.

				THE CELLAR

	After the war I was able at last to get electricity, to
have a furnace in the new cellar, to add a studio and garage
beyond the kitchen door, with the stairs to the cellar going down
under the workbench in the studio.

	I had a small cellar dug and lined with concrete
blocks and in one corner had a cistern built, lined with poured
concrete into which all rainwater from the roof would be
directed.  This was because the well which had been dug even
before the house was built had proved unsatisfactory.  For many
years that cistern was my whole water supply, until the township
brought water mains down Meadowcliff Drive and I was able to
bring township water into the house.

	The contractor who excavated the cellar for me and
installed floor drains there, had covered them up before they
could be inspected. They were a disaster, with T junctions which
constantly clogged.  At some point I had all drains from the main
floor re-routed in pipes along the cellar ceiling.  The floor

drains and the overflow from the cistern still emptied into a
grease pit out east of the house.  For further cellar drain
advice see Phase Four.

		THE BEDROOM and HALL

	The small room beyond the bathroom that I had assumed
would be a utility room, was no longer needed for that purpose,
now that I had a cellar.  I had used it as a bedroom during the
cottage days, but now, to make it feel larger, I cut into it the
big window that looks toward the ravine.  The room was far too
small to accommodate clothes closets.  But there was a space
opposite the bathroom door into which I fitted a cupboard just
deep enough for a clothes hanger.  When I was building the angled
cupboard to connect the clothes closet to the wall of the front
hall and had put doors on the top and bottom sections, I
recognized the middle as a NICHE and stopped making doors.  I
knew that some day I would find the perfect figure of some kind
to stand there. And I did.

	The pipe that runs up through the clothes closet
originally served the oil furnace in the cellar.  It is no longer
funcional.

	When I first left home I shared a bungalow at the Beach, and
my kitchen there was the laundry corner ot the cellar.  I
discovered the joy of a deep sink.  With electricity now availabe
I superannuated the wood stove.I had been using, built pine
cabinets and counters and left just enough room for the electric
version of a gas refrigerator which is still operating perfectly
more than fifty years later.  And I was able to locate a
stainless steel double sink with one deep side, and place it
under the window that looked out at the cherry tree.  Because I
enjoy seeing my kitchen plates and want them within quick reach I
made shallow shelves for them on either side of the sink.

	The disposition of each bit of kitchen furnitue was
carefully decided after I had made cardboard models to accurate
scale and played around with the pieces on the model.  My reason
for two movable units for the breakfast table was so that it
could be an extra counter and I could change its position if the
sun was shining in my eyes in the morning.  (In practice I pull
the curtain instead).

	The fuse box up near the ceiling on that wall still
serves the wiring in the original section of the house.

	The extra tap over the shallow sink brought township
water in while I continued to use the rainwater cistern for most

household purposes.  Recently I have reserved the cistern for
topping up the water in the pond.

			PHASE THREE

	In 1960 I realized that my original studio was far too
small for my increasingly demanding professional career.  I was
fortunate enough to be able to get the wonderful carpenter who
had built the original cottage to come again and add the
addition.  The cherry tree had long since died and was no longer
there to claim that piece of lawn.  The fact that my kitchen
window now opens into the studio is a real asset.  I can look up
from the dishwater and see the latest canvas unexpectedly, which
gives me a fresh impression of its virtues or failings.

	The price I paid for the new studio was the loss of
light in the kitchen.  But I spend far more time in the studio
than in the kitchen and I still have a great view from my
breakfast table, and have accepted the second best solution of
using the fluorescent lights in the daytime.

			THE PATIO

	The stone patio was the logical way to reconcile the
new studio to the old cottage.  I had great pleasure building it

and including a fountain, which Bailey Leslie, one of Canada's
notable potters, made to my design.  Its water supply is
controlled by the valve beside the tap outside the screened
porch.

	When the price of oil zoomed up I knew that I must
improve the insulation in the living-room ceiling, and with great
regret covered the beautiful pine ceiling with bats of two-inch-
thick styrephone.  The grey green colour was the result of many
try-outs, and has proved to be pleasant and in tactful harmony
with the wooden walls.

			THE POND

	When I discoverd how much I enjoyed the reflection of
the sky in the basin of the fountain, I wanted more, and started
planning the pond.  it is lined with concrete, which develops
cracks from time to time.  It also requires regular cleaning to
get rid of the muck that gathers in the bottom.

	We have found that cleaning once a year is worth the
time and trouble and that the immersion pump will empty it in
about two days. The pump can be positioned in the deep part by
using a rope to the far rim of the pond and pulling gently.  When
the water is too low for the pump to work, place the pump in a

bucket and bail Into the bucket, much easier that bailing into
the wheel barrow as we used to do.

	If the cracks that have developed in the pond are well
caulked while it is empty and dry, the only wateer lost will be
from evaporation.  The switch for the power outlet beside the
pond is on the east wall of the hall, outside the door of the
living-room.

	The valves in the cellar that direct city water into
the pond are labelled.  To put cistern water into the pond the
pump beside the cistern in the cellar must be turned on and the
appropriate tap or taps opened.

	If green scum appears on the surface of the pond during
the summer use a rake and pull it very gently in.  It will bring
with it an astonishing amount of delicate green root,
You can put a rope on the end of the rake and throw it further
out in the pond than you can reach in order to get the weed from
the centre.

	The joy of the pond is first of all the Mallard ducks
who come zooming in as soon as the ice is gone, who mate there,
fight strange drakes if they turn up, and use the pond as a lido
until the end of June or even later.  They will accept hand-out

of bread and become quite tame.

	Next are the toads who come to the pond on warm
evenings in May and sing all night to attract a mate.  They are a
wonderful chorus.  Soon you will see necklaces of toad eggs
criss-crossing the surface of the water.  Each bead turns into a
tadpole who, during the summer, grows legs and eventually hops
away as a tiny toad.  The tadpoles attract small children, who
often bring a glass jar to catch a few and take them to teacher.

	Of course all the wild animals come to the pond to
drink and more than one local dog will swim in it.  And always
it reflects the apple tree and the sky.

	The pond is five feet deep in the middle so that it
never freezes completely but it is shallow around the edge for
safety reasons.  For a few years I stocked it with goldfish, but
they are bottom-feeders and kept the mud stirred up.  I found
minnows were better and the coons and herons and king-fishers
like them very well.

	And after the surface freezes, neighbours will sweep or
shovel the snow off to let the small children have a wonderful
time on their new skates.

PHASE FOUR

	At some point I wanted more space and decided that the
garage could be enlarged and converted into a study with a .
sleepinng loft over a second bathroom and laundry, and a new
garage added on the far side.  In the process of digging a
foundation for the necessary enlargement, the machine broke the
pipe connecting the cellar drain to the grease pit and left the
broken end to rely on seepage into the soil to get rid of water
from the cellar.  This it does well enough except when a heavy
thaw or unusually heavy rain saturates the soil around the house
and water seeps through the cellar walls and builds up on the
cellar floor and cannot be drained away into the water-logged
soil.  This happens very seldom, but if it does, the way to deal
with it is to use the immersion pump in a bucket and bail into
the bucket, with the hose from the pump going out the back door
and pouring the water towards the ravine.  If the water is only
an inch or two deep it will usually drain away in a day or two by
itself.

	The garage which was converted had a concrete floor and
so this addition was completed using a concrete pad with a
foundation wall down below frost level. I don't even know where
the floor drain of the laundry delivers its water.  I am careful
not to spill or let anything overflow.  Perhaps, like the

plumbing in the new bathroom, it is all carried under or through
the floor to the septic tank which is in the ground outside the
old bathroom, under the flagstones there.  In all its years I
have never had to have the septic tank cleaned out, because I
have through the years burned the toilet paper, and body waste
does not build up solids in the tank.

	The laundry has potential access from outside, but we
have not ever used that door.  However, when the house is
occupied by a resident caretaker and a short-term tenant, there
might be some reason for separating the laundry from the
bathroom. It would be a minor job to build a frame with a
lockable door between the two, and to extend the height of the
partition with opaque glass..

			PHASE FIVE

	Shortly after having this study and guest room (the loft)
added I acquired a tenant-companion who was even better than more
space, but I still wanted my own study.

	The answer was the "Chapter House", the small, semi-
circular room tucked on to the far end of the big studio. Its
name was the result of the very Gothic appearance of the frame in

the 2x4 stage, and its function as the room where I do my
writing.

	It has been uncomplicated, no plumbing, no drains.  Its
only eccentricities are the vents, the tall narrow screened doors
beside each group of windows so that there can be a through
passage of air in spite of the windows being fixed.  Windows that
would open needed so much framing that they would have reduced
the light and the views that I demanded.

	But of course there was a price, not money, but light
in the big studio.  I lost a window.  That prompted the
installation of the three skylights in the north-west ceiling.
And they are pure joy, except in the summer when they let in as
much heat as light.  However the patio doors and the ceiling fan
work at keeping it reasonably comfortable.

	There are outside electrical outlets, one on the patio,
one outside the small door in the garage, and one on a post
beside the pond.  And in the foundation wall of the big studio
there are air vents to prevent dry rot in the beams that support
the studio.  They should be left open, but screened to keep out
animals.

	The fireplace in the living-room, and the Franklin
stove in the studio each has its own wood-box accessible from the
outside for filling, and from the inside for building the fire.
The woodboxes should be kept full, with kindling and bigger
pieces.  The draft in the living-room fireplace is opened by the
lever on the right, forward to open, away from you to close.  If
the fireplace smokes it probably means that the chimney is ready
for cleaning.  Call in a professional.

			PHASE SIX

	In order to give the resident caretaker or custodian
comlete facilities for comfortable and gracious living it became
necessary to turn the garage into a kitchen, dining space and
workshop with its own heat, (the gas fireplace) and entrance.
This also allows the tenant privacy.  Each, however,
is accessible when needed.

Since cars must now be parked outside, electric outlets
permit block heaters to be used in very cold weather.

		THE LIVING-ROOM FURNISHINGS

	The living-room is in some ways the heart of Fool's
Paradise and I have left in it the furniture, the paintings and

the accessories that gave it the character that it developed
during the years.

	The painting over the mantel was exhibited once and
failed to sell.  I brought it home, trading it for another the
same size, which sold promptly.  As I lived with the reject I
learned to love it, finding in it an endless invitation to
meditation, a gentle companion.  Now I would never sell it, and I
hope that it will prove as gracious to live with to the new
tenants as I have found it.

	The watercolour by Virginia Luz, once in the
livingroom, moved to the hall when the trophy table ousted it, is
one of her later works, a poetic semi-abstract of the Georgian
Bay world that we two shared for forty years.  My home would be
incomplete without Virginia in it.  You may read about our
friendship in volume two of my autobiography, "The Good Wine".

	The portrait of me by Judy Finch is kept so that you
may know me better than by any photograph that has ever been
taken.  And of course I hope that you will read both volumes of
my autobiography.  They tell you how, and why.

Canada and the Order of Ontario, with other such momentos as
Frances Gage's beautiful hand with a paint brush, the Julius
Griffith award from the Canadian Society of Painters in Water
Colour, The Dora De Pedery Hunt medal from the Ontario Society of
Artists and evidences of my honorary degrees.  These are all
things that I cherish because of the love that prompted them.

	The angel that is my logo you will find on the welcome
mat, on the weather vane, on the mobile above the fireplace,
which was originally a Christmas decoration but obviously
belonged all year round, and no doubt in other places here and
there.  The wooden version over the door to the kitchen was the
original, made by me in 1940.  In 1998 we had an almost tornado
that blew her off her mount above the front gable, and sent her
sailing to the ground where she lay in pieces.  Repaired, but too
fragile to put up above the roof again, she is given honourable
retirement as you see her.  A good neighbour made her replacement
in metal and put it back on the gable, although the four points
of the compass are no longer accurate.

		THE LAWN AND GARDEN

	Many years ago, when Greg Pollock was just thirteen
years old, I was able to hire him to cut my grass with his
mother's lawn mower.  She would drive him and the mower down to

my place, and he would phone her to come and get him when the job
was done.  Greg still cuts my grass and is the lawn maintenance
man for the whole community.  He has developed an impressive
business, with sophisticated machinery, trucks and tractors, and
a team of young workers who come in and leave every property
trimmed and beautiful.  He is there working with them, or alone
when the growing season is winding down.  In the winter he
ploughs the driveways.  When pruning or tree removal is necessary
he may be able to do the job himself or recommend the person who
can.

	Gardening is another matter.  The beds around the house
are mostly in perennials, but to keep out the twitch grass is a
never-ending challenge.  The garden behind the compost pit is
intended for vegetables and cutting flowers.  I hope that whoever
is the resident caretaker here when I am gone will have a green
thumb and able to make the gardens flourish.  It is too much to
hope that short-term tenants would have either time or will to
look after them.  Perhaps an interest in gardening should be a
requirement of the position.

	The woods need a bit of loving care every spring.
Trees are blown down during winter storms.  Branches fall.
Sometimes the edge of the ravine is eroded so that a tree sags
outward and threatens to fall, pulling its whole root system with

it.  Lopping that tree off above the stump may save a big piece
of table land in the woods.  And if the cut tree is allowed to
fall down the slope, it may help prevent wind erosion there.  I
have kept the paths clear, and raked them, to encouraage pleasant
walking through the woods.  But a standing dead tree makes good
habitat for birds, and I leave them until the wind brings them
down.

	Written this far in the spring of 2002 but it may
very well need revision before I die.  I leave Fool's Paradise
when that time comes, with my blessing, and good wishes that you,
whoever you are, may know joy in every aspect of living in this
beloved place.

      <dc:description>Instructions prepared by Doris McCarthy on changing her home, Fool's Paradise, for different seasons.
		CHORES TO CHANGE F.P. TO WINTER MODE

STUDY  no changes neccessary.

Studio  Screen door must be replaced by glass door stored behind
	easel.
	Table on north wall should be  cleared of boxes
underneath and folded small.  Then bring in glass iron table from
porch and place up against it. Spread cover over both.  Replace
lamp and other parephenalia and restore cartons to underneath.
Before covering, protect glass with plywood sheet stored on east
side of filing cabinet.
Bring in iron chairs and place ready to be used in living room
and studio.

MUD ROOM Remove screen door and replace with glass door. Window
screens will be stored for winter at back of coat cupboard.
Replace by double windows now in that cupboard. Bedroom,
bathroom, and livingroom all change from screens to glass at
windows.  There is no storm door for entrance, but check its
weather stripping.

KITCHEN Equip windows with their doubles.  I like the doubles
upside down to avoid reducing vision.

HALL No changes

BATHROOM Change screen to glass window.

BEDROOM Same as bathroom.

PORCH  Store on floor in north east corner, the fountain, large
base upside down, smaller basin on it also upside down,
cylindrical separater on top.  Leave big wooden chairs but remove
cushions and store under cot in study.  Shake and sweep well the
carpet and store under cot in study.  Inspect screening and
repair if necessary.  Do not store any food on porch where coons
or other animals could smell it. Leave small iron and masonite
table for use during winter, under kitchen window.
	Turn off valve in cellar that lets water reach outdoor
tap and fountain. If it drips use rubber tape to seal it. Drain
the water from that pipe before sealing.

OUTSIDE  Clean out eaves and down-drains. Fill wood cupboard
beside fireplace in livingroom. Try to use both kindling and
larger logs or split pieces. Fill to capacity, after fastening
doors to avoid them opening.  Replace old rug hanging inside door
to minimize draughts.  Break off any icicles that form over
entrances.

      <dc:description>Instructions prepared by Doris McCarthy on changing her home, Fool's Paradise, for different seasons.
	CHORES TO CHANGE F. P. FROM WINTER TO SUMMER MODE

PORCH Sweep off the winter sand and dust. Dust any furniture.
Lay down the summer rug. Look under cot in study. Bring out the
glass table and its four chairs. Cushion the big wooden chairs.
Set up the fountain and turn on its water pipe in cellar.

OTHER ROOMS  Replace double windows or doors with screens, except
in kitchen.    Put screen doors on back door and studio.

Store winter coats after spraying with Raid to avoid moth damage.

Bring down from the attic summer clothes. Better inventory all
clothes to get rid of excess.

Do not leave porch or any room with only screen door over-night.
Coons will walk through the screen. Close front door to porch.

Store all winter windows at back of coat cupboard.

Everything can be wide open during the day.

Dear Ms. McCarthy,

I was very sorry to hear of the passing of your aunt and wanted to extend my personal condolences. Your aunt's tremendous contributions to the arts community and her work as an educator and mentor have made an impact on so many. She will be remembered fondly by all who knew her.

At this difficult time, please know that my colleagues at the University of Toronto have you and your family in our thoughts. We were deeply saddened by Doris's passing and we salute her warm and generous spirit.

With best wishes,

Yours sincerely,

Family of Doris McCarthy 
1 Meadowcliff Drive 
Scarborough, ON Ml M 2X8

To the family of Doris McCarthy,

I was saddened to learn of the passing of Doris McCarthy, C.M.

Doris's legacy as a distinguished Canadian artist will live on through her remarkable artwork and three autobiographies. The University of Alberta is honoured to count her among our distinguished honorary degree holders. I admire her commitment to lifelong learning, evidenced by the Bachelor of Arts degree that she received in 1989 at the age of 76!

On behalf of the University of Alberta, I extend my sympathies for your loss.

Yours sincerely,



Indira V. Samarasekera, O.C. 
President and Vice-Chancellor

		THE GOVERNOR GENERAL • LE GOUVERNEUR GENERAL


								December 8, 2010

Dear Members of the Family of Doris McCarthy,

My wife and I are deeply saddened to hear of your loss.

	Our country has lost an exceptional Canadian and one of our greatest painters with the passing of Doris McCarthy. She will long be remembered for her outstanding contributions to the world of visual arts, and I know she will be deeply missed by all those lives she touched.

	Please take comfort in knowing that all the members of the Order of Canada join me in offering you our condolences. May good memories sustain you through this time.

	With deepest sympathy,



				David Johnston
